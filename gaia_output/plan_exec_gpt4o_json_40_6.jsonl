In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize?

Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Understand the Ball Movement Rules**:\n   - When the first piston fires, the ball in the first position is ejected, and the balls in the second and third positions move forward one space, with a new ball entering the third position.\n   - When the second piston fires, the ball in the second position is ejected, the ball in the third position moves to the first position, and two new balls enter the second and third positions.\n   - When the third piston fires, the ball in the third position is ejected, the ball in the second position moves to the first position, and two new balls enter the second and third positions.\n\n2. **Simulate the Game**:\n   - Create a simulation of the game to track the position of each ball over time.\n   - Use random firing of pistons to simulate the ejection process.\n   - Record the number of times each ball is ejected in multiple simulations to estimate the probabilities.\n\n3. **Calculate Probabilities**:\n   - Run the simulation for a large number of iterations to get a reliable estimate of the ejection probabilities for each ball.\n   - Identify the ball with the highest probability of being ejected.\n\n4. **Select the Optimal Ball**:\n   - Based on the calculated probabilities, determine which ball number has the highest chance of being ejected.\n   - This ball number will be the optimal choice to maximize the odds of winning the grand prize.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Simulate the Game**:\n   - Write a Python script to simulate the game.\n   - Initialize the ramp with balls numbered 1 to 100.\n   - Track the positions of the balls on the platform.\n   - Randomly fire pistons and update the positions of the balls accordingly.\n   - Record the ejection events for each ball.\n\n2. **Run Multiple Simulations**:\n   - Run the simulation for a large number of iterations (e.g., 10,000 or more) to gather sufficient data.\n   - Calculate the frequency of ejection for each ball.\n\n3. **Analyze Results**:\n   - Determine the ball with the highest ejection frequency.\n   - This ball is the optimal choice.\n\nLet's start by implementing the simulation in Python.\n\n### Python Code for Simulation\n\n```python\nimport random\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef simulate_game(iterations):\n    ejection_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        ramp = list(range(1, 101))\n        platform = [ramp.pop(0), ramp.pop(0), ramp.pop(0)]\n        \n        while ramp:\n            piston = random.choice([1, 2, 3])\n            \n            if piston == 1:\n                ejected_ball = platform.pop(0)\n                platform.append(ramp.pop(0))\n            elif piston == 2:\n                ejected_ball = platform.pop(1)\n                platform.insert(0, platform.pop(1))\n                platform.append(ramp.pop(0))\n            elif piston == 3:\n                ejected_ball = platform.pop(2)\n                platform.insert(0, platform.pop(1))\n                platform.append(ramp.pop(0))\n            \n            ejection_counts[ejected_ball] += 1\n            \n            if not ramp:\n                break\n    \n    return ejection_counts\n\n# Run the simulation for a large number of iterations\niterations = 10000\nejection_counts = simulate_game(iterations)\n\n# Find the ball with the highest ejection count\noptimal_ball = max(ejection_counts, key=ejection_counts.get)\noptimal_ball\n```\n\n### Execute the Code\n\nLet's run the above code to find the optimal ball number.", "tool_name": "python_interpreter", "arguments": {"code": "import random\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef simulate_game(iterations):\n    ejection_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        ramp = list(range(1, 101))\n        platform = [ramp.pop(0), ramp.pop(0), ramp.pop(0)]\n        \n        while ramp:\n            piston = random.choice([1, 2, 3])\n            \n            if piston == 1:\n                ejected_ball = platform.pop(0)\n                platform.append(ramp.pop(0))\n            elif piston == 2:\n                ejected_ball = platform.pop(1)\n                platform.insert(0, platform.pop(1))\n                platform.append(ramp.pop(0))\n            elif piston == 3:\n                ejected_ball = platform.pop(2)\n                platform.insert(0, platform.pop(1))\n                platform.append(ramp.pop(0))\n            \n            ejection_counts[ejected_ball] += 1\n            \n            if not ramp:\n                break\n    \n    return ejection_counts\n\n# Run the simulation for a large number of iterations\niterations = 10000\nejection_counts = simulate_game(iterations)\n\n# Find the ball with the highest ejection count\noptimal_ball = max(ejection_counts, key=ejection_counts.get)\noptimal_ball"}, "error": {"error_type": "AgentExecutionError", "message": "Could not parse the given action: Error in tool call execution: You tried to execute the following code:\nimport random\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef simulate_game(iterations):\n    ejection_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        ramp = list(range(1, 101))\n        platform = [ramp.pop(0), ramp.pop(0), ramp.pop(0)]\n        \n        while ramp:\n            piston = random.choice([1, 2, 3])\n            \n            if piston == 1:\n                ejected_ball = platform.pop(0)\n                platform.append(ramp.pop(0))\n            elif piston == 2:\n                ejected_ball = platform.pop(1)\n                platform.insert(0, platform.pop(1))\n                platform.append(ramp.pop(0))\n            elif piston == 3:\n                ejected_ball = platform.pop(2)\n                platform.insert(0, platform.pop(1))\n                platform.append(ramp.pop(0))\n            \n            ejection_counts[ejected_ball] += 1\n            \n            if not ramp:\n                break\n    \n    return ejection_counts\n\n# Run the simulation for a large number of iterations\niterations = 10000\nejection_counts = simulate_game(iterations)\n\n# Find the ball with the highest ejection count\noptimal_ball = max(ejection_counts, key=ejection_counts.get)\noptimal_ball\nYou got these outputs:\n\nEvaluation stopped at line '<ast.Assign object at 0x7927f8bb55d0>' because of the following error:\nAugAssign not supported for non-simple variable targets.\nYou should only use this tool with a correct input.\nAs a reminder, this tool's description is the following:\n\n- python_interpreter: This is a tool that evaluates python code.

Given the complexity of the game mechanics, a simulation approach is appropriate. However, we need to avoid the errors encountered in previous attempts. Here is a step-by-step plan to achieve this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create a list to represent the ramp with balls numbered from 1 to 100.\n   - Create a list to represent the platform that can hold three balls at a time.\n   - Create a list to count the number of times each ball is ejected.\n\n2. **Simulate the Game**:\n   - For a large number of iterations (e.g., 10,000), simulate the game to gather statistics on ball ejections.\n   - In each iteration:\n     - Initialize the ramp and platform.\n     - While there are balls on the ramp or platform, randomly select a piston to fire.\n     - Update the platform based on the piston fired and the game rules.\n     - Record the ejected ball in the ejection counts list.\n\n3. **Determine the Optimal Ball**:\n   - After running the simulation, find the ball with the highest ejection count.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Return the number of the ball with the highest ejection count.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - `ramp = list(range(1, 101))`\n   - `platform = []`\n   - `ejection_counts = [0] * 101` (index 0 will be unused)\n\n2. **Simulate the Game**:\n   - Define a function `simulate_game(iterations)`:\n     - For each iteration:\n       - Initialize `ramp` and `platform`.\n       - While there are balls on the ramp or platform:\n         - Randomly select a piston to fire.\n         - Update the platform based on the piston fired.\n         - Record the ejected ball in `ejection_counts`.\n\n3. **Determine the Optimal Ball**:\n   - After the simulation, find the index of the maximum value in `ejection_counts`.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Return the index of the maximum value in `ejection_counts`.\n\n### Python Code\n\nHere is the Python code to implement the above plan:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef simulate_game(iterations):\n    ejection_counts = [0] * 101  #

In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck down during a dragon raid and loses his left tail-fin, leaving him trapped in a sunken area. This paper investigates the feasibility of Hiccup, a teenage boy, being able to supply enough fish to maintain the dragon\u2019s diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was trapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled 716 kg. Hiccup would have had to carry 828 fish weighing at total of 8592 kg over the twelve days, which is unrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.\n\n**Introduction**\nThe How to Train Your Dragon franchise is loosely based on the popular book series by Cressida Cowell. The events take place in Viking Scotland, in the small village of Berk which is repeatedly attacked by dragons. One of the deadliest dragon species is the Night Fury, which was previously unseen by any living person. It is described as the \u201cunholy offspring of lightning and death itself\u201d due to its speed and camouflage abilities. Toothless is the only known Night Fury, and is shown to be intelligent and playful while also deadly. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the main protagonist, is a small teenage boy eager to prove himself as a Viking. Using an invention which closely resembles a net gun, Hiccup strikes down Toothless during a dragon raid. Toothless\u2019 left caudal fin is severed, rendering him unable to fly out of the sunken area, known as The Cove. Fish are a large component of a dragon\u2019s diet, and Toothless is exclusively dependent on fish for nutrition. This paper investigates whether Hiccup is able to maintain Toothless\u2019 feeding habits while he is trapped in The Cove.\n\n**Assumptions**\nSeveral assumptions and simplifications must be made to calculate the required values. During the time lapse montages in the film, it is taken that Toothless is in The Cove for a total of twelve days. It is assumed that Hiccup visited once a day for the duration of Toothless\u2019 stay. On the third day, Hiccup brings a sack of fish, and mentions that it contains Icelandic cod and salmon. There is also a pond in the clearing, and one scene shows Toothless hunting for fish. However, in this paper, it is assumed that Toothless relies solely on Hiccup for nutrition. During his time in The Cove, it is assumed that his diet consists of only salmon and cod. It is also assumed that each sack contained the same amount of fish, and that he received the same amount every day for twelve days. The sack is modelled as a cylinder, while the fish have been modelled as prolate spheroids.\n\n**Size of the bag**\nHiccup is said to be 1.625 m tall, and using average male proportions, the bag appears to be 3/8 of his height. Therefore, the height of the bag, H_bag: H_bag \u2248 3/8 (1.625 m) \u2248 0.6094 m. The bag appears to have the same height as the diameter; the diameter is taken to be 0.6094 m. Hence the radius, r: r = 1/2 (0.6094) = 0.3047 m. So, the volume of the bag, V_bag is: V_bag = \u03c0 r^2 h. V_bag = \u03c0 \u00d7 (0.3047 m)^2 \u00d7 (0.6094 m). \u2234 V_bag = 0.1777 m^3. Therefore, the bag has a capacity of 0.1777 m^3.\n\n**Fish sizes**\nThe fish considered in Toothless\u2019 diet are Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, and Icelandic cod, Gadus morhua. The average dimensions are summarised in Table 1. The length of salmon was calculated by comparing to Hiccup\u2019s height; the salmon was determined to be 1/4 of his height. The width was then established by tracing the image and comparing the ratio of the length to width. This was replicated for cod. The values were close to the lower estimates in Table 1; the final values used are summarised in Table 2. The volume of a prolate spheroid, V_p: V_p = 4/3 \u03c0 a^2 c. Where a = 1/2 width, c = 1/2 length and a < c; a is the radius and c half the head-to-tail length. Therefore, for salmon a = 0.043 and c = 0.203, and for cod a = 0.078 and c = 0.275. Using Eq. (5) the volumes of the salmon, V_S, and cod, V_C, are hence: V_S = 4/3 \u03c0 (0.043)^2 (0.203) = 0.0016 m^3. V_C = 4/3 \u03c0 (0.078)^2 (0.275) = 0.0071 m^3. Therefore, the volumes of each salmon and cod are 0.0016 and 0.0071 m^3 respectively.\n\n**Portion size**\nThe number of each fish, N_S and N_C, is multiplied by the volumes from Eq. (6) and (7) respectively. This is equal to the total volume of the bag from Eq. (4): 0.1777 = 0.0016 N_S + 0.0071 N_C. It is assumed that the salmon and cod occupy the same volumes in the bag, and that they are efficiently packed so the entire sack is occupied. Therefore; 0.0889 = 0.0016 N_S \u2234 N_S = 56. 0.0889 = 0.0071 N_C \u2234 N_C = 13. The masses of the fishes are: M_S = 56 (3.5 kg) = 196.0 kg. M_C = 25 (40 kg) = 520.0 kg. Therefore, in one day the bag contains 56 salmon and 13 cod, with a total weight of 716.0 kg.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIn the film, it appears that Toothless was in The Cove for twelve days and it was assumed that he was solely dependent on Hiccup for nutrition. The bag used to provide food was calculated as having a capacity of 0.1777 m^3, and could hold 56 Atlantic salmon and 13 Icelandic cod. Hiccup would have to carry 716 kg of fish to The Cove every day, a total of 8592 kg over the period of twelve days. Hiccup is depicted as physically weak, and is unable to even hold up a shield for a prolonged time. It is therefore concluded that Hiccup would be unable to carry the bag and could not feed Toothless for the duration of his time in The Cove, unless he made several trips, used less heavy fish, or didn\u2019t fully fill the sack."}, {"facts": "---\nThings we know:\n- The task is to find the volume in m^3 of the fish bag calculated in the University of Leicester paper titled \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon\u2019s Diet?\"\n- The paper titled 'Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon\u2019s Diet?' by Amal Doua, published in the Journal of Interdisciplinary Science Topics, investigates the feasibility of Hiccup supplying enough fish to maintain the diet of Toothless, a Night Fury dragon from the 'How to Train Your Dragon' franchise.\n- The study found that Toothless would require 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, totaling 716 kg.\n- Over twelve days, Hiccup would need to carry 828 fish weighing a total of 8592 kg, which is unrealistic given his physical limitations.\n- The study concludes that it is unrealistic for Hiccup to carry the required 8592 kg of fish over twelve days due to his physical limitations.\n- The study suggests that Hiccup would need to make multiple trips, use lighter fish, or not fully fill the sack to meet Toothless's dietary needs.\n- The full text of the paper provides detailed calculations and assumptions, including the dimensions and volume of the fish bag.\n- The volume of the fish bag, V_bag, is calculated as 0.1777 m^3.\n\nThings that can be derived:\n- The volume in m^3 of the fish bag calculated in the University of Leicester paper \"Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon\u2019s Diet?\" is 0.1777 m^3.\n\nThings to discover:\n- None", "plan": "### Step-by-Step Plan to Determine the Volume in m\u00b3 of the Fish Bag\n\n1. **Identify the Paper and Its Content**:\n   -

This period was marked by significant optimism and ambition among researchers who believed that creating a machine capable of human-like intelligence was within reach.\n\n### Key Points from the 1960s AI Research:\n\n1. **Dartmouth Conference (1956)**:\n   - Often considered the birthplace of AI as a field, the Dartmouth Conference was organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon.\n   - The conference aimed to explore the idea that \"every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\"\n   - This event set the stage for AI research in the 1960s, with the term \"artificial intelligence\" being coined to attract funding and interest.\n\n2. **Early AI Programs**:\n   - Researchers developed programs like the Logic Theorist, created by Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, and Cliff Shaw, which could prove mathematical theorems.\n   - These programs used brute force methods, systematically exploring all possible solutions to find the correct one.\n\n3. **Challenges and Limitations**:\n   - Despite initial successes, researchers quickly realized the complexity of replicating human intelligence.\n   - AI programs lacked the sensory inputs and contextual understanding that humans use to interpret the world.\n   - Language processing was particularly challenging, as early translation programs often produced humorous and incorrect results due to the lack of context and understanding.\n\n4. **Shift in Focus**:\n   - By the end of the 1960s, it became clear that creating a self-aware, generally intelligent machine (AGI) was far more difficult than anticipated.\n   - Funding for AI research began to dry up, leading to a period known as the \"AI winter.\"\n   - Researchers shifted their focus to more narrow applications of AI, leading to the development of artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) systems that could perform specific tasks effectively.\n\n5. **Legacy and Impact**:\n   - The early efforts in AI laid the groundwork for future advancements.\n   - Concepts and techniques developed during this period, such as heuristic search and symbolic reasoning, continue to influence AI research today.\n   - The dream of creating a thinking machine persists, with ongoing research exploring both the theoretical and practical aspects of AI.\n\nIn summary, \"The Thinking Machine\" in the 1960s represents the ambitious and pioneering efforts to create machines capable of human-like intelligence. While the initial goals were not fully realized, the foundational work from this era has had a lasting impact on the field of artificial intelligence."}, {"facts": "---\nThings we know:\n- The task is to identify the name of the scientist predicting the sooner thinking machines or robots in the YouTube video \"The Thinking Machine (Artificial Intelligence in the 1960s).\"\n- The video is from the 1960s, so the scientist in question would have been active during that time period.\n- The YouTube video features interviews with AI pioneers Jerome Wiesner, Oliver Selfridge, and Claude Shannon.\n- The transcript for the YouTube video is not readily available through the search results.\n- The interview will likely cover the state of computer research and artificial intelligence in the 1960s, attitudes towards computers and their capabilities, comparisons between human intelligence, instinct, and animal behavior, and insights from other scientists and psychologists on AI.\n- \"The Thinking Machine\" refers to early efforts and conceptualizations of AI during the 1960s, marked by significant optimism and ambition among researchers.\n\nThings that can be derived:\n- One of the scientists interviewed in the video (Jerome Wiesner, Oliver Selfridge, or Claude Shannon) predicted the sooner arrival of thinking machines or robots.\n\nThings to discover:\n- Which of the scientists (Jerome Wiesner, Oliver Selfridge, or Claude Shannon) specifically predicted the sooner arrival of thinking machines or robots.\n- A reliable source or method to access the transcript or content of the YouTube video to identify the scientist who made the prediction.\n---", "plan": "### Plan to Identify the Scientist Predicting the Sooner Arrival of Thinking Machines or Robots\n\n1. **Identify the Key Scientists in the Video**:\n   - We know that the video features interviews with Jerome Wiesner, Oliver Selfridge, and Claude Shannon.\n   - These are the potential candidates who might have predicted the sooner arrival of thinking machines or robots.\n\n2. **Locate the Transcript or Detailed Description of the Video**:\n   - Since the transcript is not readily available through search results, we need to find another way to access the content of the video.\n   - We can look for detailed descriptions, reviews, or summaries of the video that might mention the predictions made by the scientists.\n\n3. **Search for Specific Predictions by Each Scientist**:\n   - Perform targeted searches to find out if there are any documented predictions made by Jerome Wiesner, Oliver Selfridge, or Claude Shannon regarding the arrival of thinking machines or robots.\n   - Use search queries like \"Jerome Wiesner prediction thinking machines\", \"Oliver Selfridge prediction robots\", and \"Claude Shannon prediction AI\".\n\n4. **Analyze the Findings**:\n   - Review the information gathered from the searches to identify which scientist specifically predicted the sooner arrival of thinking machines or robots.\n   - Ensure the source is reliable and the information is accurate.\n\n5. **Confirm the Scientist's Name**:\n   - Once the scientist is identified, confirm their full name in the format \"First name Last name\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution\n\n1. **Perform Targeted Searches for Predictions**:\n   - Use the ask_search_agent tool to perform the following searches:\n     - \"Jerome Wiesner prediction thinking machines\"\n     - \"Oliver Selfridge prediction robots\"\n     - \"Claude Shannon prediction AI\"\n\n2. **Review and Analyze Search Results**:\n   - Carefully review the search results to find any mention of predictions made by these scientists.\n   - Look for reliable sources such as academic articles, interviews, or credible reviews.\n\n3. **Identify the Scientist**:\n   - Based on the information gathered, identify which scientist predicted the sooner arrival of thinking machines or robots.\n\n4. **Confirm the Scientist's Name**:\n   - Ensure the name is in the correct format \"First name Last name\".\n\nLet's begin with the first step: performing targeted searches for predictions made by each scientist.

Curt Fiedler\nSesoko Station, Tropical Biosphere Research Center, University of the Ryukyus, 3422 Sesoko,\nMotobu-cho, Okinawa 905-0227, Japan (e-mail: kaatosan@hotmail.com)\nABSTRACT\nHarlequin shrimp, Hymenocera picta , are monogamous and pair-bonding, and are usually found in\nisolated singles and pairs in the \ufb01eld. The apparent rarity of this species in their habitat and high levels ofaggression between consexuals suggests the possibility of some sort of plasticity in their primary sex\ndetermination. In this study, the in\ufb02uence of social environment upon primary sex determination in\nH. picta was examined experimentally in the laboratory. Na\u0131 \u00a8ve juveniles were placed in three novel social\nenvironments: paired juveniles, single juveniles, and adult/juvenile pairs. Spacing behavior and the onset\nof external differentiation were observed during long-term experiments for each social treatment. Gonadal\ndevelopment was also observed. Spacing behavior of paired shrimp re\ufb02ected the sexual composition ofsocial groups; high intrapair distance (IPD) for same-sex pairs and low IPD for opposite-sex pairs. Sexdetermination results were not so clear. Two of the three paired juvenile replicates displayed phenotype\nfrequencies different from those expected from a random sample of gonochoristic organisms with a 1:1\nsex ratio. However, the third replicate and the combined frequencies did not show any statistical differencefrom the hypothetical random sample. Furthermore, single juveniles and those paired with adultsexpressed sex in nearly 1:1 ratios, regardless of the sex of adult conspeci\ufb01cs. Histological examination of\njuvenile shrimp con\ufb01rmed that sex was determined as early as four weeks after larval metamorphosis.\nTherefore, social environment had no clear effect upon sexual phenotype expressed. However, singlefemales attained puberty at a signi\ufb01cantly greater age and larger size than did females paired with males.\nHence for H. picta , social environment had a measurable effect on the timing of female puberty. This is the\n\ufb01rst demonstration of this phenomenon in decapod Crustacea.\nThe phenomenon of environmental sex de-\ntermination (ESD) (Bull, 1983) is well docu-\nmented in many teleost \ufb01sh families in the\nform of some sort of sequential hermaphrodit-ism (Atz, 1964; Smith, 1975; Yogo, 1987).\nThe best such examples in \ufb01sh involve the\nsocial environment and its effect on sex (e.g.,Fricke and Fricke, 1977; Moyer and Nakazono,1978; Warner, 1982). In crustaceans, however,\nthere appears to be little direct evidence of so-\ncial control of functional sex. The best knownexamples occur in parasitic bopyrid isopods\nand protandrous hermaphrodite shrimp of the\nfamily Pandalidae. In bopyrid examples, the\ufb01rst individual to reach a host becomes female\nand may cause subsequent conspeci\ufb01cs to be-\ncome male (Reverberi, 1944; Reinhard, 1949;Charniaux-Cotton et al. , 1983). In pandalid\nshrimp, the timing of male-female sex change\nis thought to be in\ufb02uenced by the demo-\ngraphics of their populations (Charnov, 1982).However, the mechanism of such a system is\nin doubt (Bergstro \u00a8m, 1997).Examples of hermaphroditism in the mala-\ncostracan Crustacea are relatively uncommon\nand usually are in the form of protandrous sex\nchange. Hermaphroditism is known from manyspecies in a few subgroups of isopods and tanai-\ndaceans (Charniaux-Cotton, 1975; Policansky,\n1982). However, only approximately 42species of decapod crustaceans are thought tobe hermaphroditic, and 35 of these are caridean\nshrimp (see lists in Carpenter, 1978; Policansky,\n1982; Bauer, 2000) (and for additional exam-ples see Kagwade, 1981; Sukumaran, 1981;\nBauer, 1986; Nakashima, 1987; Gherardi and\nCalloni, 1993; Gavio et al. , 1994; Rudolph,\n1995; de Almeida and Buckup, 1997, 2000;\nBauer and Holt, 1998; Fiedler, 1998). Further-\nmore, at least two hippolytid carideans in thegenus Lysmata display a form of simultaneous\nhermaphroditism (Bauer and Holt, 1998;\nFiedler, 1998). Because marine decapods share\nmany of the same ecological and habitat selec-tion pressures with teleost \ufb01shes, it is surpris-\ning to \ufb01nd so few examples in this diverse\n750JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY, 22(4): 750\u2013761, 2002group of crustaceans. Perhaps past research has\nnot focused closely on the best crustacean can-didates for sex change.\nHarlequin shrimp, Hymenocera picta (Dana,\n1852), are small caridean shrimp that may beideal candidates for studies on plastic sex de-\ntermination. They are found in shallow coastal\nwaters (1\u201330 m) of the tropical Indo-Paci\ufb01c re-gion but are apparently uncommon throughout\ntheir range (personal observation; Debelius,\n1984). The shrimp are hardy in captivity andare popular aquarium pets, but only eat aster-oid echinoderms (Wickler, 1973; Debelius,\n1984). Males and females are sexually di-\nmorphic and form monogamous pair bondsthat are maintained via mate-guarding behavior\nby males (Wickler, 1973; Seibt and Wickler,\n1979). Both males and females are aggressivetowards individuals of the same sex, and males\nwill readily \ufb01ght each other to death in an en-\ncounter. Also, adults are not known to changesex. Mature females spawn 100\u20135,000 eggsevery 18\u201326 days, concurrent with their molt\ncycle (Seibt and Wickler, 1979; Kraul and\nNelson, 1986). Hymenocera larvae pass\nthrough twelve planktonic zoeal stages and\nreach the settlement stage in 5\u20136 weeks (Kraul\nand Nelson, 1986; Fiedler, 1994). Postlarvaebegin eating seastars \ufb01ve days after meta-\nmorphosis (Fiedler, 1994).\nGiven the relative rarity of these animals,\ntheir high intraspeci\ufb01c aggression, the dispersal\nof their prey, and the low probability of larval\nsurvival, it seems likely that a mechanism en-suring access to the opposite sex would haveevolved. This might be accomplished via the\nability to follow distant chemical cues from the\nopposite sex or a mechanism of environmen-tally (socially) regulated juvenile sex determi-\nnation. Harlequin shrimp certainly \ufb01t the\ncriteria for one of three models for the evolu-tion of hermaphroditism proposed by Ghiselin\n(1969). The Low Density Model implies that\nthere is an advantage in \u2018\u2018being able to matewith any member of the species, where theprobability of encountering a suitable mate is\nlow\u2019\u2019 (Ghiselin, 1969: 200). This model sug-\ngests the evolution of simultaneous hermaphro-ditism or labile juvenile sex determination in\nmarine animals, like harlequin shrimp, with\nlimited postlarval dispersal. In this study, I as-sess the presence of such mechanisms in juve-\nnile Hymenocera picta . These experiments\nexamine social in\ufb02uence on the primary sexdetermination of this species.M\nATERIALS AND METHODS\nIn order to examine the effect of social environment on\nthe primary sex determination of Hymenocera picta , a series\nof \ufb01ve experiments was carried out in which postlarvae wereplaced into arti\ufb01cial social situations in the laboratory. In the\u2018\u2018Paired Juveniles\u2019\u2019 experiment (replicates I, II, and III),pairs of postlarvae were isolated and observed closely over aperiod of several months. In the \u2018\u2018Single Juveniles\u2019\u2019\nexperiment, postlarvae were isolated individually and\nmonitored. In the \u2018\u2018Adult/Juvenile Pairs\u2019\u2019 experiment, singlepostlarvae were isolated with one adult shrimp. In the\u2018\u2018Histology/Morphology Pairs\u2019\u2019 experiment, postlarval pairswere isolated and sacri\ufb01ced at regular intervals in order toexamine morphological characteristics of primary sexdetermination. The three social contexts (juvenile conspe-\nci\ufb01c, adult conspeci\ufb01c, and no conspeci\ufb01c) were intended to\nsimulate the potential social environments that Hymenocera\npicta postlarvae experience in the \ufb01eld. All the experiments\nare explained in detail below.\nExperiment One: Paired Juveniles\nIn this experiment, I assessed the presence of socially\nregulated Environmental Sex Determination (ESD) duringthe juvenile phase of Hymenocera picta by observing the\nbehavior and differentiation of isolated juvenile pairs. Underoptimal ESD, we would expect that an isolated pair ofjuvenile shrimp would mature as a male/female pair.\nAdditionally, I expect that spacing behavior would re\ufb02ect\nthe sexes of the pairs as occurs in H. picta adults. Seibt\n(1980) observed arti\ufb01cial groupings of adult H. picta in the\nlaboratory and found that individuals of the opposite sexwere found in closer proximity than those of the same sex.\nThree replicates of this experiment were performed and\ndesignated as replicates I, II, and III. All three replicates\nwere conducted at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biologyunder similar conditions.\nReplicate I .\u2014Forty-two Hymenocera picta postlarvae,\napproximately two weeks postmetamorphosis, were ob-\ntained from the Waikiki Aquarium. Individual shrimp wererandomly selected, by drawing numbers from a hat, andplaced into twenty pairs. The two extra shrimp were heldin reserve and not used. Shrimp pairs were isolated in small(8 l) plastic buckets. The buckets were arranged in twowet tables and provided \ufb02owing sea water via a polyvinyl\nchloride (PVC) pipe frame in each wet table. Buckets had\nholes drilled approximately 4 cm under the rim to facilitatewater \ufb02ow. Each bucket was provided with its own aerationsource. Shrimp were fed small (approximately 1 cm) piecesof seastar ( Linckia spp.) ad libitum during the experiment.\nDecaying food and detritus were siphoned from the buckets\nas needed.\nPairs were monitored for seven months (1 July 1991\u20138\nFebruary 1992). The data recorded during the experimentincluded the Intra-Pair Distance (IPD), total length (TL), andsecondary sex characteristics. These data were recordeddaily during the \ufb01rst month of the experiment and atincreasingly longer intervals (2\u20137 d) in the remaining six\nmonths. I measured IPD with a transparent, \ufb02exible ruler,\nrecording the linear distance separating two shrimp betweenthe bases of their respective antennae. Total length (TL) wasrecorded weekly by carefully removing shrimp from theircontainers with a clear glass beaker that was then placedabove an opaque plastic ruler. The TL was recorded as the\nlinear distance between the tips of the rostrum and the\nuropod. Although carapace length (CL) would have been amore reliable indication of size, measuring TL was most751 FIEDLER: SEX DETERMINATION IN HYMENOCERA PICTAexpedient and less stressful to these delicate shrimp. The\nonset date of maturity (appearance of secondary sexcharacters) was determined by carefully examining the ventralabdomen of shrimp for female characteristics. Characteristicsof female puberty included the presence of white or red\npigment and eggs on pleopods. Although males possess\nmorphologically distinct pleopods, they remain transparent.This made it dif\ufb01cult to record the presence of structures suchas the appendix masculina on living individuals. Therefore,male puberty was recorded as the date at which an individualwas able to fertilize its partner (if female). The sex of\nmorphologically indistinct individuals was inferred by\nplacing them with adults of known sex and observing theirstereotypical behavior (Wickler and Seibt, 1970). Unusual orobviously agonistic behavior was also noted throughout theexperiment.\nReplicate II .\u2014For this replicate, postlarvae were obtained\nfrom a clutch reared by the author (for larval rearingprotocol, see Fiedler, 1994) at the Hawaii Institute of MarineBiology. Forty experimental postlarvae were randomlyselected from a total of 86 healthy individuals 2\u20134 weekspast metamorphosis. The experimental procedure was\nidentical to replicate I with the following exception: IPD\nwas measured every 5\u20137 d throughout the experiment,which ran for approximately 6 months (4 July 1992\u201328December 1992).\nReplicate III .\u2014For this replicate, forty postlarvae were\nobtained from a clutch of 61 reared by the author (as above).These postlarvae metamorphosed 1\u20134 weeks prior to theexperiment. The experimental procedure was identical toreplicate I, with the following exceptions. First, IPD wasrecorded every 1\u20133 days for approximately the \ufb01rst threemonths and at increasingly longer intervals (3\u201311 days) for\nthe rest of the experiment. Second, the experiment ran for\nmore than eight months (25 May 1995\u201328 January 1996).\nExperiment Two: Single Juveniles\nAs a control and comparison for paired juvenile\ndevelopment, postlarvae were isolated singly and observed\nas above. If sex determination in this species is sociallyregulated ESD, I hypothesize that single shrimp experi-encing the same social environment (no conspeci\ufb01c) woulddifferentiate as the same sex (either all males or females). Analternative hypothesis is that the presence of no conspeci\ufb01c\nrepresents no social environment, and individuals will\nmature as males or females in equal proportions.\nTwenty postlarvae were randomly chosen from the same\nclutch used for Paired Juveniles, replicate II. Shrimp weremaintained in buckets, as above, in a single large wet table.The experiment duration was 11 months (4 July 1992\u201315June 1993). All individuals were observed (same schedule\nas Paired Juveniles II) for presence of secondary sex\ncharacteristics (female) and measured (TL) when sex couldbe judged. The sex of all individuals was veri\ufb01edbehaviorally at the completion of the experiment.\nExperiment Three: Adult/Juvenile Pairs\nIn the \ufb01eld, it is unlikely that juveniles encounter only\njuvenile conspeci\ufb01cs. To simulate such natural conditions,newly metamorphosed individual juveniles were randomlypaired and isolated with sexually mature adult individuals.Cues from adult shrimp may have a more pronounced effect\nupon the ESD of juveniles. If this is the case, juveniles\nshould predominantly mature as the opposite sex of theiradult partners.Sixteen postlarvae were randomly selected from the same\nclutch used for Paired Juveniles, replicate III. Half of thesewere individually paired with adult male Hymenocera picta .\nThe other half were individually paired with adult females.Nine of the adults were wild-caught, whereas seven others\nwere laboratory-reared (some left over from Paired Juveniles\nreplicate II). The animals were maintained and observed asin the Paired Juveniles experiment, with the followingexceptions. First, experimental buckets were larger (12 l)and each was provided with a standard shelter ( ;5c m\nlength of 3.8-cm diameter PVC pipe half) as a refuge for the\nsmall juveniles. Second, IPD and shrimp TL were measured\non the same schedule as Paired Juveniles, replicate III.Third, the onset of juvenile maturity was assessed bydetermining the presence of external female sex character-istics or fertility of partner\u2019s eggs. In the cases wherejuvenile sex was \u2018\u2018unknown,\u2019\u2019 shrimp were sexed behavior-ally. The duration of this experiment was approximately\nseven months (24 May 1995\u201331 December 1995).\nExperiment Four: Morphology/Histology Pairs\nIf the sex determination of Hymenocera picta juveniles is\nplastic or labile, there may be evidence of bipotentiality injuvenile gonads and in some external secondary sexcharacteristics. Therefore, histological examination of pairedjuveniles sacri\ufb01ced during the putative maturation periodwas undertaken.\nTen pairs of juveniles were randomly selected from\nremnants of the clutch used for the Paired Juveniles,\nreplicate II and Single Juveniles experiments. Pairs wereisolated and maintained in buckets in the same manner usedin the Paired Juveniles experiment. Behavioral and spacingobservations were not made during this experiment. Overthe course of the experiment (5 July 1992\u201319 September\n1992), pairs were selected at random at approximately 7-d\nintervals (beginning 23 July 1992) and sacri\ufb01ced forhistological examination. Sacri\ufb01ced shrimp were \ufb01xed in10% seawater Formalin. Fixed shrimp were examined andmeasured (TL and CL) under a dissection microscope. Theappendages, abdomen, and carapace were then excised from\n\ufb01xed specimens. The remaining cephalothorax was em-\nbedded in paraplast media following decalci\ufb01cation (withFisher brand CalEx), dehydration (EtOH), and clearing(toluene). The entire cephalothorax was used in order toobserve the location and morphology of gonoducts. In allcases, 8 lm transverse serial sections were made for detailed\nobservation of the morphology and histology of the entire\ngonad. Sections were mounted on glass slides, stained with\nHarris progressive hematoxylin and eosin (Galigher andKozloff, 1971), and examined with a compound microscope.\nData Analyses\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using the software\npackage \u2018\u2018StatView v"}, {"facts": "---\nThings we know:\n- The total length of the harlequin shrimp mentioned in Omar Valencfia-Mendez's 2017 paper is approximately 4.5 cm.\n- The 2002 paper by G.
