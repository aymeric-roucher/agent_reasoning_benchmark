The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100.

Here is the refined step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Understand the Mechanism of the Game:**\n   - **Initial Setup:** The first three balls (1, 2, and 3) are placed on the platform.\n   - **Piston Actions:**\n     - If the first piston fires, the ball in the first position is ejected, and the balls in the second and third positions move forward one space, with the next ball on the ramp moving to the third position.\n     - If the second piston fires, the ball in the second position is ejected, the ball in the first position rolls away, the ball in the third position moves to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp move to the second and third positions.\n     - If the third piston fires, the ball in the third position is ejected, the ball in the first position rolls away, the ball in the second position moves to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp move to the second and third positions.\n\n2. **Simulate the Game:**\n   - Create a simulation to model the game and track the position of each ball over multiple stages.\n   - Use random selection to determine which piston fires at each stage.\n\n3. **Calculate Probabilities:**\n   - Run the simulation multiple times to gather data on how often each ball is ejected.\n   - Calculate the probability of each ball being ejected based on the simulation results.\n\n4. **Analyze Results:**\n   - Identify the ball with the highest probability of being ejected.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Simulate the Game:**\n   - Write a Python script to simulate the game.

the positions of the balls on the platform according to the rules.\n     - Track which ball is ejected at each stage.\n\n2. **Run the Simulation:**\n   - Execute the simulation for a large number of iterations (e.g., 10,000 or more) to ensure statistical significance.\n\n3. **Calculate Probabilities:**\n   - Count the number of times each ball is ejected.\n   - Divide the count for each ball by

maximize the odds of winning, we need to simulate the game and calculate the probabilities of each ball being ejected. Here is the refined step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Understand the Mechanism of the Game:**\n   - **Initial Setup:** The first three balls (1, 2, and 3) are placed on the platform.\n   - **Piston Actions:**\n     - If the first piston fires, the ball in the first position is ejected, and the balls in the second and third positions move forward one space, with the next ball on the ramp moving to the third position.\n     - If the second piston fires, the ball in the second position is ejected, the ball in the first position rolls away, the ball in the third position moves to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp move to the second and third positions.\n     - If the third piston fires, the ball in the third position is ejected, the ball in the first position rolls away, the ball in the second position moves to the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp move to the second and third positions.\n\n2. **Simulate the Game:**\n   - Create a simulation to model the game and track the position of each ball over multiple stages.\n   - Use random selection to determine which piston fires at each stage.\n\n3. **Calculate Probabilities:**\n   - Run the simulation multiple times to gather data on how often each ball is ejected.\n   - Calculate the probability of each ball being ejected based on the simulation results.\n\n4. **Analyze Results:**\n   - Identify the ball with the highest probability of being ejected.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Simulate the Game:**\n   - Write a Python script to simulate the game. The script should:\n     - Initialize the ramp with balls numbered 1 to 100.\n     - Place the first three balls on the platform.\n     - Randomly select a piston to fire at each stage.\n     - Update the positions of the balls on the platform according to the rules.\n     - Track which ball is ejected at each stage.\n\n2. **Run the Simulation:**\n   - Execute the simulation for a large number of iterations (e.g., 10,000 or more) to ensure statistical significance.\n\n3. **Calculate Probabilities:**\n   - Count the number of times each ball is ejected.\n   - Divide the count for each ball by

Ejections:**\n   - Keep a count of how many times each ball is ejected.\n\n4. **Run Multiple Iterations:**\n   - Repeat the simulation for a large number of iterations to gather sufficient data.\n\n5.

The script should:\n     - Initialize the ramp with balls numbered 1 to 100.\n     - Place the first three balls on the platform.\n     - Randomly select a piston to fire at each stage.\n     - Update the positions of the balls on the platform according to the rules.\n     - Track which ball is ejected at each stage.\n\n2. **Run the Simulation:**\n   - Execute the simulation for a large number of iterations (e.g., 10,000 or more) to ensure statistical significance.\n\n3. **Calculate Probabilities:**\n   - Count the number of times each ball is ejected.\n   - Divide the count for each ball by the total number of iterations to get the probability of ejection.\n\n4. **Identify the Optimal Ball:**\n   - Determine which ball has the highest probability of being ejected.\n\n### Simulation Code\n\nLet's write the simulation code step-by-step to avoid errors:\n\n1. **Initialize the Ramp and Platform:**\n   - Create a list of balls numbered 1 to 100.\n   - Place the first three balls on the platform.\n\n2. **Simulate the Piston Actions:**\n   - Randomly select a piston to fire.\n   - Update the positions of the balls on the platform according to the rules.\n\n3. **Track Ejections:**\n   - Keep a count of how many times each ball is ejected.\n\n4. **Run Multiple Iterations:**\n   - Repeat the simulation for a large number of iterations to gather sufficient data.\n\n5. **Calculate Probabilities:**\n   - Calculate the probability of each ball being ejected.\n\n6. **Identify the Optimal Ball:**\n   - Find the ball with the highest probability of being ejected.\n\nHere
