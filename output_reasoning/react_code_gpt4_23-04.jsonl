Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\n\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the 'Code:' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- search: A search engine. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your search query', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

You MUST provide at least the 'Code:' sequence to move forward.\n\nRemember to not perform too many operations in a single code block! You should split the task into intermediate code blocks. Then use one single print() at the end of each step to save the intermediate result. Then use final_answer() to return the final result.\n\nDO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n\nNow Begin! \n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Task: Which of the original Seven Sisters colleges had a Columbia University administrator as one of its Presidents?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: I need to find out the names of the original Seven Sisters colleges and then search for each one to see if any had a Columbia University administrator as one of its Presidents.

The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- search: A search engine. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your search query', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize?

In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick.

The task is to maximize the odds of winning, so I will try to deduce a pattern based on the rules provided for the pistons firing and the movement of the balls on the platform.\n\nThe pattern of the balls being ejected must be traceable based on how the balls advance and are ejected. The ejection sequence seems to follow a predictable pattern based on the position of the ball and the piston that fires. The key to solving this riddle is to determine the sequence of balls ejected and find a ball number that appears frequently or predictably.\n\nWe know that the balls start at positions 1, 2, and 3. If the first piston fires, ball number 1 is ejected and ball number 4 moves into position 3. If the second piston fires, ball number 2 is ejected, ball number 1 is out of the game, ball number 4 moves to position 1, and ball number 5 moves to position 3. If the third piston fires, ball number 3 is ejected, ball number 2 moves to position 1, ball number 4 moves to position 2, and ball number 5 moves into position 3.\n\nBased on the description, the ball in position 1 will always be ejected if piston 1 or 2 fires. The ball in position 2 will only be ejected if piston 2 fires. The ball in position 3 will only be ejected if piston 3 fires. This means balls will be ejected from position 1 more frequently than from positions 2 or 3.\n\nGiven that we have 100 balls and a seemingly random pattern of piston firing, we can assume that each piston has an equal chance of firing at any given time. This would mean that over many rounds, the ball in position 1 has a higher chance of being ejected than the balls in the other two positions because it can be ejected by two out of the three pistons.\n\nSince this is a mathematical pattern and not an actual game simulation, we can deduce that it is more likely for balls that enter position 1 more frequently to be ejected. Thus, the ball number that ends up in position 1 the most often throughout the game would be the one to choose.\n\nLet's consider the sequence of balls that will enter position 1:\n- Initially, balls 1, 2, and 3 are in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n- If piston 1 fires, ball 4 will be in position 3, and if piston 2 fires afterward, ball 4 will move to position 1.\n- If piston 3 fires initially, ball 4 will be in position 2, and if piston 2 fires afterward, ball 4 will move to position 1.\n\nBased on this, ball number 4 will move to position 1 if piston 2 fires after either piston 1 or piston 3 fires. Since there's no restriction on the sequence of piston firing, we have to consider the probability of ball number 4 moving to position 1 as fairly high.\n\nHowever, since we cannot run a simulation, we need to deduce the pattern further. Given the rules, if we consider the firing sequence of pistons 1-2-3 to be a cycle, after each complete cycle, the next ball that will move into position 1 is two numbers higher than the ball that was there at the start of the cycle. This is because if piston 1 fires, the next ball moves to position 3; if piston 2 fires, that ball moves to position 1; and if piston 3 fires, the next ball in the sequence moves to position 2, ready to be moved to position 1 if piston 2 fires in the next cycle.\n\nBy this pattern, every third ball starting with ball 4 (i.e., balls 4, 7, 10, 13, ...) will have a high chance of moving to position 1 and thus being ejected.

Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in Western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.

The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order.

The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box.

Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\n\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the 'Code:' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- search: A search engine. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your search query', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\n\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the 'Code:' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- search: A search engine. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your search query', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Then use one single print() at the end of each step to save the intermediate result. Then use final_answer() to return the final result.\n\nDO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n\nNow Begin! \n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Task: What was the complete title of the book in which two James Beard Award winners recommended the restaurant where Ali Khan enjoyed a New Mexican staple in his cost-conscious TV show that started in 2015?

The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- search: A search engine. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events.

Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\n\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the 'Code:' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- search: A search engine. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your search query', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
