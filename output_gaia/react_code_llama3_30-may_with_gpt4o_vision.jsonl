In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "Of the authors (First M.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "I need to fact-check a citation.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "What integer-rounded percentage of the total length of the harlequin shrimp recorded in Omar Valencfia-Mendez 2017 paper was the sea star fed to the same type of shrimp in G.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin!

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "The photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art's collection with accession number 2022.128 shows a person holding a book.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "It is 1999.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "In the 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com, what was the command they clicked on in the last video to remove extra lines?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I need to find the 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com and watch the last video to see what command they clicked on to remove extra lines.

Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "In Valentina Re\u2019s contribution to the 2017 book \u201cWorld Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\u201d, what horror movie does the author cite as having popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality?

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

Human-induced global warming of 1.1 degrees Celsius has led to unprecedented changes in Earth's climate, with severe impacts on natural ecosystems and human societies.\n2. Climate change is widespread, rapid, and intensifying, affecting all regions across the globe.\n3. The number of climate-related disasters has increased, causing widespread damage and disruption, with developing nations being disproportionately impacted.\n4. The window to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is rapidly closing, and urgent, transformative action is needed across all sectors to adapt to and mitigate climate change.\n5. Immediate and large-scale emissions reductions are required to limit warming, with a specific focus on transitioning to clean energy sources and reducing deforestation.\n6. Adaptation actions can help manage climate risks, but there are limits to their effectiveness, especially in areas experiencing compound extremes and slow-onset events.\n7. Nature-based solutions can play a crucial role in both mitigation and adaptation, but their effectiveness depends on proper implementation and conservation of ecosystems.\n8. Many adaptation and mitigation options have multiple benefits for sustainable development and can contribute to reducing poverty and improving health and well-being.\n9. Current climate finance levels fall far short of the estimated need for adaptation and mitigation, especially in developing countries, and innovative solutions are required.\n10. Integrated risk management approaches, including early warning systems, are critical to reducing climate risks and protecting the most vulnerable communities.\n"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: Based on the summary provided, I didn't find any mentions of \"nuclear energy\".

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "What is the volume in milliliters of a system comprised of 0.312 kg Freon-12 refrigerant when placed at the bottom of the Marianas Trench and allowed to stabilize at the Trench's peak temperature, rounded to the nearest mL?

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "Find the value of x to the nearest tenth: Lx = (d/dx * (A * x-squared)) + 4-thousand'n'ninety-7 minus C\nWhere L is the last two digits of the year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence,\nA is the number of colors in the TikTok logo as of July 2023, excluding black and white,\nand C is the height of the average woman in the Philippines according to a July 2023 Business Insider article, rounded to the nearest whole centimeter"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To solve for x, I need to find the values of L, A, and C.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "Examine the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec.\n\nWhat does Teal'c say in response to the question \"Isn't that hot?\""}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I will use the transcriber tool to transcribe the audio from the YouTube video, and then I will inspect the transcription to find the answer to the question.\n\nCode:\n```py\ntranscription = transcriber(audio=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec\")\nprint(transcription)\n```<end_action>\n\n", "rationale": "Thought: I will use the transcriber tool to transcribe the audio from the YouTube video, and then I will inspect the transcription to find the answer to the question.\n\n", "tool_call": {"tool_name": "code interpreter", "tool_arguments": "transcription = transcriber(audio=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec\")\nprint(transcription)"}, "error": {"error_type": "AgentExecutionError", "message": "Failed while trying to execute the code below:\n\u001b[0mtranscription = transcriber(audio=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec\")\nprint(transcription)\u001b[0m\nThis failed due to the following error:\ncould not convert string to float: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec'"}}, {"llm_output": "Thought: It seems that the transcriber tool expects an audio file, not a YouTube video URL.

It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "The attached spreadsheet shows the inventory for a movie and video game rental store in Seattle, Washington.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "In terms of geographical distance between capital cities, which 2 countries are the furthest from each other within the ASEAN bloc according to wikipedia?

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

Given: 15419 `inputs` tokens and 1500 `max_new_tokens`.", "intermediate_steps": [{"system_prompt": "You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to *tools*: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "What is the minimum number of page links a person must click on to go from the english Wikipedia page on The Lord of the Rings (the book) to the english Wikipedia page on A Song of Ice and Fire (the book series)?

Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "Which of the text elements under CATEGORIES in the XML would contain the one food in the spreadsheet that does not appear a second time under a different name?\nYou have been provided with these initial arguments: {'attached_file_path': 'data/gaia/validation/9b54f9d9-35ee-4a14-b62f-d130ea00317f.zip'}."}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I will first extract and inspect the contents of the zip folder using the `extract_inspect_zip_folder` tool.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "What time was the Tri-Rail train that carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019 scheduled to arrive in Pompano Beach?

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "How many applicants for the job in the PDF are only missing a single qualification?\nYou have been provided with these initial arguments: {'attached_file_path': 'data/gaia/validation/bfcd99e1-0690-4b53-a85c-0174a8629083.zip'}."}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I will start by extracting the zip folder to access the PDF file.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "According to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I will use the `ask_search_agent` tool to search for the historical prices of Apple stock on Google Finance and find the first year when it went above $50.\n\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = ask_search_agent(query=\"Apple stock price history on Google Finance\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\n\nPlease provide the output of the search agent.", "rationale": "Thought: I will use the `ask_search_agent` tool to search for the historical prices of Apple stock on Google Finance and find the first year when it went above $50.\n\n", "tool_call": {"tool_name": "code interpreter", "tool_arguments": "answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"Apple stock price history on Google Finance\")\nprint(answer)"}, "observation": "I have accessed the Apple Inc.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "Given $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I will use Newton's Method to find the root of the given function.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "You are given this Excel file as a map.

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "I thought we could try a fun word puzzle together :)\n\nI've got a Boggle board here:\n\nABRL\nEITE\nIONS\nFPEI\n\nI'd like to know the longest word that can be generated from the board.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin!

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "According to the World Bank, which countries had gross savings of over 35% of GDP for every year in the period 2001-2010?

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "I\u2019m thinking about selling my home, so I want to learn more about how homes in my area sold recently.

If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "How many times was a Twitter/X post cited as a reference on the english Wikipedia pages for each day of August in the last June 2023 versions of the pages?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I will break down the task into smaller steps.

Most claimed ancestry from chieftains of the period preceding the establishment of the kingdom around the year 1000, or were descended from western European knights who settled in Hungary. Only those who owned lands free of obligations were regarded as true noblemen. Other groups, known as conditional nobles, also existed. Under customary law, only males inherited noble estates. The poorest nobles lost their tax exemption from the mid\u201316th century. The ennoblement of whole groups was not unusual in the 17th century. A group of 10,000 *hajd\u00fak received nobility in 1605. After the Diet was divided into two chambers in 1608, noblemen with a hereditary title had a seat in the upper house. Reformist noblemen demanded the abolition of noble privileges from the 1790s. Noble titles were only abolished in 1947, after Hungary was proclaimed a republic.\n (\nFull\u00a0article...)\n\nRecently featured:\n* Coccinellidae\n* 1995 Aigio earthquake\n* 'My Man' (Tamar Braxton song)\n\n* Archive\n* By email\n* More featured articles\n* About\n\nDid you know\u00a0...\n----------------\n\n\nTwo salt marsh snakes\n\n* ... that salt marsh snakes (examples pictured) can be as short as 15 inches (38\u00a0cm)?\n* ... that I Gede Pasek Suardika resigned the chairmanship of the Nusantara Awakening Party to be succeeded by his formerly imprisoned colleague Anas Urbaningrum?\n* ... that the Sea to Sky Gondola was vandalized twice in two consecutive years, costing the company millions?\n* ... that Indian singer Sudakshina Sarma sang in Assamese as Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s ashes were immersed in the Brahmaputra River?\n* ... that Solo Per Due claims to be the smallest restaurant in the world and only serves meals for two?\n* ... that Jarren Horton's childhood dream was to serve as an American football defensive coordinator under his father, and he now does so with the Pittsburgh Maulers (2022)?\n* ... that the 14th- and 15th-century Azerbaijani poet\nReferences for August 5: 0\nResult for August 6: See Observation.\nReferences for August 6: 0\nResult for August 7: Error in generating final llm output: 424 Client Error: Failed Dependency for url: https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus/v1/chat/completions (Request ID: KAjTXSHBQfaoY4reI-S9z)\n\nRequest failed during generation: Server error: CANCELLED.\nReferences for August 7: 1\nResult for August 8: Error in generating final llm output: 422 Client Error: Unprocessable Entity for url: https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-plus/v1/chat/completions (Request ID: lNnRfq3UtYSEPtHcsnZE-)\n\nInput validation error: `inputs` tokens + `max_new_tokens` must be <= 32768.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "The attached image contains a Python script.

Answer with the following format: x.xx", "prediction": "0.01", "intermediate_steps": [{"system_prompt": "You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to *tools*: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "I have the Standard plan in the image below, and I just uploaded 60 equally sized files and got a message that I'm 100GB over the limit.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "The attached PDF lists accommodations in the resort community of Seahorse Island.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "Who did the actor who played Ray in the Polish-language version of Everybody Loves Raymond play in Magda M.?

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "On the BBC Earth YouTube video of the Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments, what species of bird is featured?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I will use the `transcriber` tool to transcribe the audio of the video and then use the `ask_search_agent` tool to find the species of bird featured.\n\nCode:\n```py\naudio =...  # assume we have the audio of the video\ntranscript = transcriber(audio=audio)\nprint(\"Transcript:\", transcript)\n```<end_action>\n", "rationale": "Thought: I will use the `transcriber` tool to transcribe the audio of the video and then use the `ask_search_agent` tool to find the species of bird featured.\n\n", "tool_call": {"tool_name": "code interpreter", "tool_arguments": "audio =...  # assume we have the audio of the video\ntranscript = transcriber(audio=audio)\nprint(\"Transcript:\", transcript)"}, "error": {"error_type": "AgentExecutionError", "message": "Failed while trying to execute the code below:\n\u001b[0maudio =...  # assume we have the audio of the video\ntranscript = transcriber(audio=audio)\nprint(\"Transcript:\", transcript)\u001b[0m\nThis failed due to the following error:\nfloat() argument must be a string or a real number, not 'ellipsis'"}}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I need to get the video's description or transcript from the YouTube video.

The aim is to build an accurate, fast, and reliable fruit detection system, which is essential for fruit yield estimation and autonomous harvesting in agricultural robotics. Recent advancements in deep neural networks for object detection are leveraged to develop an effective strategy for fruit detection, focusing on sweet peppers.\n\nThe proposed system, DeepFruits, employs a Faster R-CNN model that achieves a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.838 for sweet pepper detection, considering both precision and recall. The network is trained and tested on a customized dataset consisting of various field-captured images and images from Google Images.\n\nThe paper also discusses in detail the challenges encountered during data collection and the methods used to address them. Furthermore, it highlights the successful training of the deep neural network and the superior detection performance achieved by the system.\n"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I finally have some information about the DeepFruits paper, but it doesn't seem to mention a graph on Connected Papers.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "Pull out the sentence in the following 5x7 block of text.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "The attached spreadsheet contains a list of books I read in the year 2022.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "Consider the following symbols: \ud809\udc1c  \ud809\udc10\ud809\udc1a\n\nThis is a number written using the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system and represented with Sumerian cuneiform.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "Of the cities within the United States where U.S. presidents were born, which two are the farthest apart from the westernmost to the easternmost going east, giving the city names only?

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "Eva Draconis has a personal website which can be accessed on her YouTube page.

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "As of August 2023, who is the only winner of the US version of Survivor to be born in the month of May?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I will use the search agent to get the list of winners of the US version of Survivor, and then filter out the ones born in May.\n\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = ask_search_agent(query=\"List of winners of the US version of Survivor\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\n\n(Please wait for the observation to proceed)", "rationale": "Thought: I will use the search agent to get the list of winners of the US version of Survivor, and then filter out the ones born in May.\n\n", "tool_call": {"tool_name": "code interpreter", "tool_arguments": "answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"List of winners of the US version of Survivor\")\nprint(answer)"}, "observation": "Here is the full list of Survivor US winners:\nSeason 1: Richard Hatch \nSeason 2: Tina Wesson\nSeason 3: Ethan Zohn\nSeason 4: Vecepia Towery\nSeason 5: Brian Heidik\nSeason 6: Jenna Morasca\nSeason 7: Sandra Diaz-Twine\nSeason 8: Amber Brkich\nSeason 9: Chris Daugherty\nSeason 10: Tom Westman\nSeason 11: Danni Boatwright\nSeason 12: Aras Baskauskas\nSeason 13: Yul Kwon\nSeason 14: Earl Cole\nSeason 15: Todd Herzog\nSeason 16: Parvati Shallow\nSeason 17: Bob Crowley\nSeason 18: J.T.

Answer using the format DD/MM/YYYY.", "prediction": "Unable to determine", "intermediate_steps": [{"system_prompt": "You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to *tools*: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "When was a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas first added to the Wikipedia page on the Principle of double effect?

Here is the text of the article:\n\n'Several million years ago, the core of our galaxy experienced a powerful event. It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A* for short).\n\nThese bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were [the first to observe these wispy trails](https://www.universetoday.com/154593/imaging-the-galaxys-centre-in-unprecedented-detail-reveals-more-mysterious-filaments/). Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n![MeerKAT image of the galactic center with color-coded position angles of the vertical filaments.

Courtesy Farhad Yusef-Zadeh/Northwestern University\n\n### Wait, There\u2019s More!\n\nRecently, the team found a smaller population of filaments near Sgr A*. However, these aren\u2019t vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. \u201cIt was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,\u201d Yusef-Zadeh said. \u201cWe have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I\u2019m used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.\u201d\n\nHe and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \u201cWe had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren\u2019t fooling ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole. By studying them, we could learn more about the black hole\u2019s spin and accretion disk orientation. It is satisfying when one finds order in a middle of a chaotic field of the nucleus of our galaxy.\u201d\n\nYusef-Zadeh pointed out that something clearly occurred in the core to create the short radial filaments. \u201cWe think they must have originated with some kind of outflow from an activity that happened a few million years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to be the result of an interaction of that outflowing material with objects near it.\u201d\n\n![MeerKAT image of the galactic center with color-coded position angles of the short, radial filaments.

Courtesy: Farhad Yusef-Zadeh/Northwestern University\n\n### Pinning Down Filament Histories\n\nLike other supermassive black holes, Sgr A* has been known to swallow up material occasionally. Then, it \u201cburps out\u201d an energetic, highly magnetized blast of energy and plasma. That seems the most likely explanation for the appearance of the bubbles and filaments. It\u2019s possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\n\nAnother idea is that molecular gas got stretched by'\n"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: Now that I have the article, I need to find the paper mentioned at the bottom of the article.

These radio filaments are most likely tracing magnetic fields that are organized in the galactic disk,\u201d said Yusef-Zadeh.\n\nResearch into the strange strands continues, deciphering exactly what the strands are, how they were formed and how they stay suspended above the galactic center in what is called the galactic halo. Finding answers is key to understanding the activity in the center of our galaxy.\n\nYusef-Zadeh has proposed two possibilities for the origin of this new population.\n\nOne possibility is that this new population is tracing cosmic rays inspired by past burst activity of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole located in the galactic center. Other possibilities are that the cosmic rays were inspired by past star formation activity in the galactic center or one or more supernova explosions.\n\nThe second possibility, he said, \u201cis that the radio filaments are tracing pre-existing large-scale magnetic fields, amplified during past burst activity of star formations or a supermassive black hole activity.\u201d\n"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I still don't have a direct link to the paper, but I can try to find more information about the paper using the `ask_search_agent` tool.\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = ask_search_agent(query=\"Find the paper by Farhad Yusef-Zadeh's team about their observations of filaments at the center of the Milky Way, including the NASA award number supporting R.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "Where were the Vietnamese specimens described by Kuznetzov in Nedoshivina's 2010 paper eventually deposited?

Despite over a decade of efforts, the nature of FRBs remains elusive, with no single model adequately explaining the range of observed events. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 supports the idea that magnetars may be the source of FRBs. However, the emission duration and energetic requirements challenge existing models. The authors emphasize the need for coordinated observational and theoretical efforts across a wide energy band, similar to approaches taken for other classes of objects first detected in a single band. They summarize the results of multiwavelength search campaigns conducted for several FRBs, especially repeaters, and highlight the importance of accurate localization for triggering follow-up observations. The paper concludes by advocating for more dedicated multiwavelength campaigns with improved sensitivity to transient events occurring on millisecond to minute timescales. Development of dedicated instrumentation and strategies such as fast photometry and coordinated observations with small/medium-size radio telescopes are suggested as key directions for future progress in unraveling the mysteries of FRBs.\nPaper 2 info: The title of the paper about fast radio bursts from July 2020 is 'The physical mechanisms of fast radio bursts', available on the Nature website.\n"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I don't see any information about the X-ray time profile or the time span in the search results.

FRBs are powerful energy emissions that can release as much energy as the sun in a few thousandths of a second. The physical mechanisms behind FRBs are still somewhat mysterious, but it's clear that they involve extremely energetic processes in the universe.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- extract_inspect_zip_folder: Use this to extract and inspect the contents of a zip folder.\n    Takes inputs: {'folder': {'description': 'The path to the zip folder you want to inspect.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\nNever try to guess file paths for files that do not exist.\n", "task": "In NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day on 2006 January 21, two astronauts are visible, with one appearing much smaller than the other.
