Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "A paper about AI regulation that was originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 shows a figure with three axes, where each axis has a label word at both ends.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "I\u2019m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them.

The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

Over time, balls that reach the platform later have progressively fewer rounds of exposure on the platform positions (1, 2, 3) before the available balls for the simulation run out.\n\n2. **Simulation Path**:\n   - Balls entering the ramp earlier will generally cycle through the platform positions more frequently before running out.\n   - As it's a fixed simulation (starting with 100 balls), number 1 will have the highest exposure to piston selection compared to later numbers.\n\n3. **Mathematical and Logical Approach**:\n   - Every ball has 3 positions (1, 2, and 3) activation possibility.\n   - When the balls lessen, ramp entries progressively shift prime positions to prior balls.\n\nGiven these logical deductions, the first few balls have the highest probability of being ejected by the pistons due to their primary entry positions and prolonged recycling on the platform.\n\nThus, the ball that should have the highest odds of being ejected by any of the pistons maximizes if you select the first available ball.\n\n**Answer**:\nTo maximize your odds of winning the grand prize, choose ball number **1**.", "intermediate_steps": [{"system_prompt": "You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to *tools*: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python.

Since executing code is not a viable approach at this stage, I'll pivot to solve this riddle through critical reasoning.\n\n1. **Observation**:\n   The piston mechanism ejects 1 of the 3 balls at each stage. Over time, balls that reach the platform later have progressively fewer rounds of exposure on the platform positions (1, 2, 3) before the available balls for the simulation run out.\n\n2. **Simulation Path**:\n   - Balls entering the ramp earlier will generally cycle through the platform positions more frequently before running out.\n   - As it's a fixed simulation (starting with 100 balls), number 1 will have the highest exposure to piston selection compared to later numbers.\n\n3. **Mathematical and Logical Approach**:\n   - Every ball has 3 positions (1, 2, and 3) activation possibility.\n   - When the balls lessen, ramp entries progressively shift prime positions to prior balls.\n\nGiven these logical deductions, the first few balls have the highest probability of being ejected by the pistons due to their primary entry positions and prolonged recycling on the platform.\n\nThus, the ball that should have the highest odds of being ejected by any of the pistons maximizes if you select the first available ball.\n\n**Answer**:\nTo maximize your odds of winning the grand prize, choose ball number **1**."}], "parsing_error": false, "iteration_limit_exceeded": false, "agent_error": NaN, "start_time": "2024-05-28 20:56:58", "end_time": "2024-05-28 20:58:20", "task": 1, "true_answer": "3"}

Always use the right arguments for the tools.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "In July 2, 1959 United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products listed as dehydrated, consider the items in the \"dried and dehydrated section\" specifically marked as dehydrated along with any items in the Frozen/Chilled section that contain the whole name of the item, but not if they're marked Chilled.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Using the Biopython library in Python, parse the PDB file of the protein identified by the PDB ID 5wb7 from the RCSB Protein Data Bank.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "What are the EC numbers of the two most commonly used chemicals for the virus testing method in the paper about SPFMV and SPCSV in the Pearl Of Africa from 2016?

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "In April of 1977, who was the Prime Minister of the first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther (in the New International Version)?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To solve this task, I need to follow these steps:\n1.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Use density measures from the chemistry materials licensed by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew under the CK-12 license in LibreText's Introductory Chemistry materials as compiled 08/21/2023.\n\nI have a gallon of honey and a gallon of mayonnaise at 25C.

If Yes, answer Yes, otherwise, give me the word in my citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).", "prediction": "Yes", "intermediate_steps": [{"system_prompt": "You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to *tools*: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "I need to fact-check a citation.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Which contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To identify the contributors to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model, I need to first determine the specific version of OpenCV that includes this update.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "An office held a Secret Santa gift exchange where each of its twelve employees was assigned one other employee in the group to present with a gift.

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "What animals that were mentioned in both Ilias Lagkouvardos's and Olga Tapia's papers on the alvei species of the genus named for Copenhagen outside the bibliographies were also present in the 2021 article cited on the alvei species' Wikipedia page about a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To find the animals that were mentioned in both Ilias Lagkouvardos's and Olga Tapia's papers about the alvei species of the genus named for Copenhagen, and also present in a 2021 article cited on the alvei species' Wikipedia page, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.

H. alvei produces Acyl Homoserine Lactones (AHLs), used in quorum-sensing (QS) for promoting enzymatic activities in fermented foods, and can produce antibacterial compounds like bacteriocins. Characterizing these molecules holds potential benefits for clinical medicine and food industries. Some strains can produce biogenic amines or other significant compounds in food health.\n\n### Keywords\nHafnia alvei, quorum-sensing, probiotics, biopreservation, foodborne pathogens\n\n### Introduction\nHafnia alvei is a Gram-negative bacterium found in various environments and the digestive tracts of animals. Recent taxonomy improvements have clarified identification methods for distinguishing H. alvei from related species. Despite evidence of some virulence traits and toxin genes, comprehensive studies on the factors contributing to its pathogenicity and interactions with food matrices are still needed.\n\nFor the complete article, including in-depth sections and scientific discussions, please navigate to the provided link and download the PDF or read it directly on the webpage.\nTo read the full text of **\"The Probiotic Strain H. alvei HA4597\u00ae Improves Weight Loss in Overweight Subjects under Moderate Hypocaloric Diet: A Proof-of-Concept, Multicenter Randomized, Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study\"**, you can visit the PMC (PubMed Central) page directly.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Each cell in the attached spreadsheet represents a plot of land.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Which of the text elements under CATEGORIES in the XML would contain the one food in the spreadsheet that does not appear a second time under a different name?\nYou have been provided with these initial arguments: {'attached_file_path': 'data/gaia/validation/9b54f9d9-35ee-4a14-b62f-d130ea00317f.zip'}."}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To determine the text elements under CATEGORIES in the XML that would contain the one food in the spreadsheet that does not appear a second time under a different name, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "\u00ac(A \u2227 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 \u00acB)\n\u00ac(A \u2228 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB)\n(A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA)\n(A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 B)\n(\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB)\n\u00ac(A \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2227 \u00acB)\n\nWhich of the above is not logically equivalent to the rest?

In the **Find box**, enter the following regex pattern to match empty lines:\n   ```\n   ^(\\s)*$\\n\n   ```\n\n5. **Leave the Replace box empty**.\n\n6. Click on **Replace All**.\n\nThis process will effectively remove all empty lines from your code.\n\nIf you're looking for a VSCode extension to facilitate this, you can lookup for extensions like the `remove-break-lines` extension available on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jalescardoso.remove-break-lines).\n\nFor more detailed instructions or variations, you can refer to [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50042278/visual-studio-code-remove-blank-lines-from-code).\n\nFor the exact video command information, you might need to refer to video tutorials or YouTube channels that cover Visual Studio Code tips and tricks, such as the one mentioned in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQhwWjdwQtM).\n\nI hope this helps!

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "In Valentina Re\u2019s contribution to the 2017 book \u201cWorld Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries\u201d, what horror movie does the author cite as having popularized metalepsis between a dream world and reality?

Therefore, it appears that Valentina Re's contribution centers more on TV series and the broader phenomenon of metalepsis within transmedia storytelling.\n\nIf you need specific information about a horror movie dealing with metalepsis between a dream world and reality, you might need to look into separate scholarly articles or books specifically focused on such works in the horror genre. For instance, the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" series is famed for its blending of dream and reality, a theme commonly discussed in media studies.\n"}, {"llm_output": "Given the observation, it doesn't appear that Valentina Re mentions any specific horror movie related to metalepsis between a dream world and reality in her contribution to the book.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "In Nature journal's Scientific Reports conference proceedings from 2012, in the article that did not mention plasmons or plasmonics, what nano-compound is studied?

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Who nominated the only Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur that was promoted in November 2016?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To find the nomination details of the only Featured Article about a dinosaur that was promoted in November 2016 on English Wikipedia, I will need to search for articles that match these criteria.

Given these limitations, it is challenging to ascertain the exact issue through direct validation. However, we can provide a reasoned conclusion based on available information and known validation rules.\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. **Validation Method**: The checksum is calculated in a similar manner to ISBN-13 but with alternate weights of 1 and another positive integer `w` (where `2 <= w < 10`).\n2. **Transposed Columns**: Errors occurred in two adjacent columns that are not the final column or one of the first three columns (focus on columns indexed 3 to 10).\n\n### Steps to Formulate Reasoned Conclusion:\n1. **Validation Function**: For a number `d1d2...d12d13`, calculate the checksum as:\n\n   \\[\n   S = d1 \\times 1 + d2 \\times w + d3 \\times 1 + d4 \\times w + ... + d12 \\times w + d13\n   \\]\n   \n   The condition for a valid checksum is \\( S \\mod 10 = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Adjacency Transposition**: When considering transposing columns `i` and `i+1`, the checksum calculation should adjust accordingly.\n\n3. **Manual Examination**: Although we cannot run code directly here, we can reason through each step for various weights and transpositions to identify potential solutions.\n\nWhile a comprehensive examination for all combinations is ideal, you can validate specific combinations manually using tools or additional scripts.\n\n### Potential Conclusion:\nHere are some initial fixed scenarios based on general assumptions and validations:\n- For simplicity, consider validating for specific weights and manually transposed indices. For columns between 3 to 10 and weights from 2 to 9, if any combination consistently validates all examples, it is closely verified.\n\n### Hypothetical Valid Output:\nIf upon further manual or external validation steps, the results produced for specific weights and transpositions validate all given numbers, we might get:\n\nExample Result:\n- Potential weight: `3`\n- Transposed index: `4`\n\nRepresented as:\n```\n3, 4\n```\n\nThis example assumes validation for known outputs; extend details as needed manually or using validated scripts on respective local setups.\n\nFor further granular steps, consider leveraging stable local Python environments or analytical scripts.

Given these limitations, it is challenging to ascertain the exact issue through direct validation. However, we can provide a reasoned conclusion based on available information and known validation rules.\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. **Validation Method**: The checksum is calculated in a similar manner to ISBN-13 but with alternate weights of 1 and another positive integer `w` (where `2 <= w < 10`).\n2. **Transposed Columns**: Errors occurred in two adjacent columns that are not the final column or one of the first three columns (focus on columns indexed 3 to 10).\n\n### Steps to Formulate Reasoned Conclusion:\n1. **Validation Function**: For a number `d1d2...d12d13`, calculate the checksum as:\n\n   \\[\n   S = d1 \\times 1 + d2 \\times w + d3 \\times 1 + d4 \\times w + ... + d12 \\times w + d13\n   \\]\n   \n   The condition for a valid checksum is \\( S \\mod 10 = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Adjacency Transposition**: When considering transposing columns `i` and `i+1`, the checksum calculation should adjust accordingly.\n\n3. **Manual Examination**: Although we cannot run code directly here, we can reason through each step for various weights and transpositions to identify potential solutions.\n\nWhile a comprehensive examination for all combinations is ideal, you can validate specific combinations manually using tools or additional scripts.\n\n### Potential Conclusion:\nHere are some initial fixed scenarios based on general assumptions and validations:\n- For simplicity, consider validating for specific weights and manually transposed indices. For columns between 3 to 10 and weights from 2 to 9, if any combination consistently validates all examples, it is closely verified.\n\n### Hypothetical Valid Output:\nIf upon further manual or external validation steps, the results produced for specific weights and transpositions validate all given numbers, we might get:\n\nExample Result:\n- Potential weight: `3`\n- Transposed index: `4`\n\nRepresented as:\n```\n3, 4\n```\n\nThis example assumes validation for known outputs; extend details as needed manually or using validated scripts on respective local setups.\n\nFor further granular steps, consider leveraging stable local Python environments or analytical scripts.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "I was trying to remember how well the Cheater Beater performed in comparison to the Cheater when James tested it on his channel.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "On a leap day before the year 2008, a joke was removed from the Wikipedia page for \u201cDragon\u201d.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Find the value of x to the nearest tenth: Lx = (d/dx * (A * x-squared)) + 4-thousand'n'ninety-7 minus C\nWhere L is the last two digits of the year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence,\nA is the number of colors in the TikTok logo as of July 2023, excluding black and white,\nand C is the height of the average woman in the Philippines according to a July 2023 Business Insider article, rounded to the nearest whole centimeter"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To solve the task, we need to follow these steps:\n1.

If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "In the endnote found in the second-to-last paragraph of page 11 of the book with the doi 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv, what date in November was the Wikipedia article accessed?

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin!

In the reference file is a layout of the road and nearby houses. Each dash, \"-\", is a marker indicating a mile. Each capital H indicates a house located next to a mile marker, appearing above or below the stretch of road. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value.", "prediction": "Analyzing the provided layout and manually derived house positions, the house locations are:\n\n- Houses located at miles: 0, 8, 11, 20, 24, 28.\n\nTo find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed, we need to ensure each tower covers houses within an 8-mile range (4 miles on each side).\n\n## Step-by-Step Greedy Algorithm:\n1. **Sort and Deduplicate Positions:**\n   Derived positions from manual inspection:\n   - Sorted and unique house positions: `[0, 8, 11, 20, 24, 28]`\n\n2. **Covering the Houses with Towers:**\n   - Start from the first house, place a tower at a position such that it covers the maximum range of houses.\n   - Move to the next house outside the current tower's coverage and repeat the process.\n\n### Derived Steps:\n1. Start with house at position 0, place a tower at `0 + 4 = 4` to cover houses from `0` to `8`.\n2. The next uncovered house is at `11`, place a tower at `11 + 4 = 15` to cover until `15`.\n3. The next uncovered house is at `20`, place a tower at `20 + 4 = 24` to cover until `28`.\n\nEach of these positions covers the houses within an 8-mile (4 + 4) range efficiently.\n\n### Summary:\n- Towers placed at positions: `4, 15, 24`.\n- All positions are covered with minimal towers = **3 towers**.\n\nThus, the minimum number of cell phone towers required to cover all houses adjacent to the road is **3**.", "intermediate_steps": [{"system_prompt": "You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to *tools*: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road.

However, based on the web results gathered, I'll summarize the key findings relevant to \"High-linoleic acid diet, high-stearic acid diet, high trans fatty acid diet study.\"\n\n### High-Linoleic Acid Diet\n**Findings:**\n- **Effect on Cholesterol:** High-linoleic acid diets have shown to significantly reduce serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Linoleic acid helps in reducing hypercholesterolemia, possibly by inducing early structural changes in liver tissues. \n- **Liver Function:** In a study involving hypercholesterolemic rat models, the linoleic acid-treated group exhibited improved liver function test results and significant reduction in serum cholesterol levels.\n\n### High-Stearic Acid Diet\n**Findings:**\n- **Cardiovascular Risks:** Stearic acid tends to raise LDL cholesterol levels, lower HDL cholesterol, and increase the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol compared with diets rich in unsaturated fatty acids.\n- **Lipids and Fibrinogen:** Some studies indicated that high-stearic acid diets might increase lipoprotein (a) levels and plasma fibrinogen when dietary stearic acid exceeds certain thresholds.\n\n### High Trans Fatty Acid Diet\n**Findings:**\n- **Cholesterol Levels:** Diets high in trans fatty acids are associated with increased levels of LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol while decreasing HDL cholesterol. This imbalance is linked to an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases.\n- **Overall Health Impact:** Consuming trans fats is known to have deleterious effects on heart health and is strongly correlated with higher incidences of coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular-related conditions.\n\n### General Implications:\n- **High-Linoleic Acid:** Beneficial for reducing cholesterol levels and improving overall lipid profiles, suggesting potential advantages in cardiovascular risk reduction.\n- **High-Stearic Acid:** Mixed results with some beneficial aspects (like no significant impact on cholesterol) but potential risks like increased lipoprotein(a) and fibrinogen levels.\n- **High Trans Fatty Acids:** Consensus indicates significant negative health impacts, particularly on cardiovascular health, and should be minimized in the diet.\n\nThese summaries synthesize the findings from reputable studies related to these dietary fats and their health impacts, particularly focusing on cardiovascular risk factors and cholesterol management.

Male mice were fed ten isocaloric diets that varied systematically in their proportions of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. These differences in diet resulted in distinctive metabolic and behavioral traits in both fathers (F0) and their offspring (F1).\n\n#### Macronutrient Compositions:\n\nThe experimental diets were designed with specific proportions of macronutrients:\n\n- **Proteins**: This varied in different diets where some were low in protein and others had high-protein content.\n- **Fats**: Proportions ranged from low-fat to high-fat diets.\n- **Carbohydrates**: Similarly, carbohydrate levels ranged from low to high in different diets.\n\n#### Findings:\n\n1. **Body Composition**:  \n   Fathers consuming high-fat diets showed reduced body mass gains and body fat percentages, whereas high-carbohydrate diets led to increased liver triglyceride accumulation.\n\n2. **Metabolic Health**:  \n   - High protein diets correlated positively with liver, quadriceps, and kidney weight. \n   - Paternal diets that were low in protein and high in carbohydrates were linked with a higher anxiety-like phenotype in male offspring.\n\n3. **Behavioral Traits**:  \n   - Male offspring of fathers fed low protein-high carbohydrate diets exhibited anxiety-like behaviors.\n   - The nature of these behaviors varied greatly depending on the balance of macronutrients in the paternal diet.\n\n4. **Offspring Health and Development**:  \n   - Female offspring of males fed high-fat diets had increased deposits of subcutaneous white adipose tissue and reduced brown adipose tissue.\n   - Insulin sensitivity in offspring was influenced by paternal carbohydrate intake.\n\n5. **Caloric Intake**:  \n   Males fed low-protein diets consumed more food, demonstrating a protein leverage effect.\n\n#### Detailed Data and Table:\n\nDue to space constraints in this summary, please refer to \"Table 1\" in the original study for comprehensive data on the macronutrient compositions of the ten experimental diets, along with specific outcomes on metabolic and behavioral traits detected in both generations.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nThis study highlights the significant impact paternal diet can have on the metabolic and behavioral health of offspring, emphasizing the intricate interplay between macronutrient balance and overall energy intake.\n"}, {"error": {"error_type": "AgentMaxIterationsError", "message": "Reached max iterations."}, "final_answer": "Based on the detailed information gathered for each of the table captions/references, we've been able to deduce the studies corresponding to the given references.

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "The work referenced in footnote 397 of Federico Lauria's 2014 dissertation is also the source for the titles of two paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection, as of August 2023.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Given $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To solve this task, we need to apply Newton's Method to the function \\( f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8 \\) starting at \\( x_0 = -5 \\).

A Count of Moldova, La\u021bcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u0218irnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u0218irnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u0218irnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u0218irnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u0218irnea have been turned into vampires?", "prediction": "99", "intermediate_steps": [{"system_prompt": "You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to *tools*: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "What is the area of the green polygon in the attached file?

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "What is the surname of the equine veterinarian mentioned in 1.E Exercises from the chemistry materials licensed by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew under the CK-12 license in LibreText's Introductory Chemistry materials as compiled 08/21/2023?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To find the surname of the equine veterinarian mentioned in 1.E Exercises from the specified chemistry material, I will first need to access this specific section of the materials.

To tally the citations of Twitter/X posts, I'd ideally need an automated way to fetch these pages and analyze them. My access to tools is limited in this regard, but I can make a high-level plan:\n\n1. List English Wikipedia pages (this can be an extensive list).\n2. Access the June 2023 revisions for each of these pages.\n3. Search each revision for citations of Twitter/X posts.\n4. Tally these counts for each day in August.\n\nAn automated solution requires web scraping techniques, but here, I will describe the methodology and partially simulate the logic involved in identifying the citations. This high-level plan follows:\n\n### Cross-referencing Historical Pages and Counting Twitter/X Citations\n\n1. **List Wikipedia Pages**: Find or use a predefined list of prominent Wikipedia pages or categories.\n2. **Access Historical Revisions**: Fetch the June 2023 snapshots.\n3. **Detect Citations**: Parse each document to find Twitter/X references.\n4. **Count per Day in August**: Summarize the counts for each date in August.\n\nUnfortunately, without an automated scraping tool, I\u2019ll detail the methodology and pseudo-code where implementation interfaces with web pages would be.\n\n### Step-by-Step Simulation and Approximation\n\nIn Python, using tools like requests, BeautifulSoup, and possibly an existing Wikipedia API, we can imagine the following steps:\n\n### 1. List Wikipedia Pages\nWe would gather a comprehensive or targeted list of Wikipedia pages. For example, a list of popular or frequently edited pages.\n\n### 2. Access June 2023 Revisions\nUse the Wikipedia API or manually browse to fetch these specific historical pages.\n\n### 3. Detect Citations\nParse the content for citations conforming to the structure of Twitter/X URLs.\n\n### 4. Count per Date in August\nSummarize counts based on the dates found.\n\nLet's simulate these steps in a code-like format.\n\n#### Simulated Code Outline\n\n```py\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\n\n# Placeholder Wikipedia pages (normally, we'd have a list or category-based query)\nwikipedia_pages = [\"Artificial_intelligence\", \"Climate_change\", \"Python_(programming_language)\"]\n\n# URL template for getting historical revisions from Wikipedia\nwiki_revision_url_template = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title={}&oldid={}\"\n\n# Placeholder for simulated June 2023 revision IDs\nrevisions = {\n    \"Artificial_intelligence\": \"115000000\",\n    \"Climate_change\": \"115000001\",\n    \"Python_(programming_language)\": \"115000002\"\n}\n\n# Placeholder function to count Twitter citations\ndef count_twitter_citations(html_content, date_prefix):\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n    citations = soup.find_all('a', href=lambda href: href and \"twitter.com\" in href)\n    return len(citations)\n\ncitation_counts = {}\nfor page in wikipedia_pages:\n    revision_id = revisions[page]\n    response = requests.get(wiki_revision_url_template.format(page, revision_id))\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        html_content = response.text\n        for day in range(1, 32):\n            # Simulate checking for updates on each day of August\n            date_prefix = f\"2023-08-{day:02d}\"\n            count = count_twitter_citations(html_content, date_prefix)\n            citation_counts[date_prefix] = citation_counts.get(date_prefix, 0) + count\n\nprint(citation_counts)\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThis simulation outlines the methodology, but the actual implementation requires real interfacing with live data and parsing systems.\n\nGiven the complexity and limitations, obtaining exact numbers requires extensive real-time handling.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "What is the last word before the second chorus of the King of Pop's fifth single from his sixth studio album?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To answer this question, I need to determine what the King of Pop's (Michael Jackson's) fifth single from his sixth studio album (\"Thriller\") is, and then find the lyrics.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Hi, I'm making a pie but I could use some help with my shopping list.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "The attached image contains a Python script.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin!

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "It's May 2023, and I'm about to drive across the U.S. from California to Maine.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "The YouTube channel Game Grumps began a Let\u2019s Play of the game Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) in the year 2012.

Here's a break down of the code:\n1. The code begins with two import statements: `from random import randint` imports the `randint` function from the `random` module, which generates random integers. `import time` imports the `time` module, which allows for sleep delays.\n2. The class `UhOh` is defined as a subclass of the built-in `Exception` class. This class doesn't have any specific implementation, it just acts as a custom exception.\n3. The class `Hmm` is defined with an `__init__` method that initializes an instance variable `value` with a random integer between -100 and 100 using the `randint` function.\n4. The `Yeah` method of the `Hmm` class checks if the `value` is equal to 0. If it is, the method returns `True`. Otherwise, it raises the custom `UhOh` exception.\n5. The `Okay` function is a generator function that yields instances of the `Hmm` class. The generator continuously creates new instances of `Hmm` and yields them, essentially creating an infinite loop.\n6. The `keep_trying` function takes a generator (`go`) and a boolean (`first_try`) as arguments. It retrieves the next value generated by the `go` generator and stores it in the `maybe` variable. Then, it attempts to call the `Yeah` method on `maybe`. If `Yeah` returns `True`, the function returns the `value` of `maybe`. If `Yeah` raises an `UhOh` exception, the function handles it by printing messages indicating that it's still working and then recursively calling itself with `first_try` set to `False`.\n7. In the `__name__ == \"__main__\"` block, a `go` generator is created by calling the `Okay()` function. The `keep_trying` function is then called with `go` as an argument, and the returned value is printed.\n\nIn summary, this script generates random instances of the `Hmm` class and tries to find one with a `value` of 0. If it finds one, it returns that value. If it encounters an `UhOh` exception (meaning the `value` is not 0), it keeps trying until it either finds a suitable value or runs indefinitely. The script is designed to showcase a certain coding pattern involving generators and exceptions. The use of the `time.sleep` delay and the printed messages indicate that the code is attempting to perform some sort of \"work\" while waiting for a specific outcome (`value` equal to 0).

The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "The attached spreadsheet contains a list of books I read in the year 2022.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "On Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has \"witnesses\" in the most titles as of 2021?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I need to navigate the Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website to find the relevant information.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Of the cities within the United States where U.S. presidents were born, which two are the farthest apart from the westernmost to the easternmost going east, giving the city names only?

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query.

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Eva Draconis has a personal website which can be accessed on her YouTube page.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "The cover of the August 2021 issue of Vogue shows a famous landmark in the background behind some trees.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Hi, I was out sick from my classes on Friday, so I'm trying to figure out what I need to study for my Calculus mid-term next week.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "When was a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas first added to the Wikipedia page on the Principle of double effect?

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin!

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "According to Openreview.net, at the NeurIPS 2022 Conference, how many papers by an author named Yuri were accepted with a \"certain\" recommendation?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To find out how many papers by an author named Yuri were accepted with a \"certain\" recommendation at the NeurIPS 2022 Conference, I will need to first search for the list of accepted papers and their authors.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Where were the Vietnamese specimens described by Kuznetzov in Nedoshivina's 2010 paper eventually deposited?

The leading models propose magnetars as potential sources, supported by recent detections from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154. However, emission durations and energy budgets present challenges to these models.\n\n2. **Multiwavelength Search Campaigns**: The search for counterparts across optical/NIR and high-energy wavelengths has been critical. Several campaigns have been conducted, especially focusing on repeaters. The findings suggest that more dedicated campaigns sensitive to millisecond-to-minute timescale transients are essential.\n\n3. **Observational Results**:\n   - Multiwavelength campaigns have yet to detect significant high-energy counterparts.\n   - Optical counterpart searches, including those using fast photometry, have not detected simultaneous emissions with radio bursts.\n   - X-ray and gamma-ray observations have set stringent upper limits on transient emissions.\n\n4. **Dedicated Instrumentation**: The need for specialized instruments capable of high cadence and fast photometry is emphasized. Instruments like SiFAP2 and HiPERCAM are highlighted for their potential in capturing the fast optical bursts associated with FRBs.\n\n5. **Host Galaxies**: Current identifications of FRB host galaxies are predominantly star-forming galaxies, which may indicate a connection with young magnetars formed via core-collapse supernovae. \n\n6. **Future Directions**: The study underscores the importance of continued and enhanced multiwavelength observational campaigns, improved instrumentation, and systematic searches for new FRB sources to solve the FRB enigma.\n\nIn conclusion, solving the various aspects of FRBs' origins, characteristics, and counterparts requires advancing current observational strategies and technologies, focusing particularly on high-sensitivity and high-temporal resolution measurements.\n"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: It is apparent that searching through the document text directly on Arxiv or referencing summaries might not provide the specific details we need.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will browse the internet to answer a query. Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "Who are the pitchers with the number before and after Taish\u014d Tamai's number as of July 2023?

Use it to gather informations, not for problem-solving.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'Your query, as a natural language sentence. You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': 'audio', 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as text and ask questions about it.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "What is the first name of the only Malko Competition recipient from the 20th Century (after 1977) whose nationality on record is a country that no longer exists?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: To find the first name of the Malko Competition recipient from the 20th Century (after 1977) whose nationality on record is a country that no longer exists, I need to list the winners of the Malko Competition within the specified time frame and determine their nationalities. \n\nI will start by searching for the list of Malko Competition winners from 1977 onwards.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "In the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition titled after the Chinese zodiac animal of 2015, how many of the \"twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac\" have a hand visible?"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: The Chinese zodiac animal for the year 2015 is the Sheep (or Goat).

Provide as much context as possible.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n\nRemember: Your $FINAL_ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.\nADDITIONALLY, your $FINAL_ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)\nIf you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and don't include units such as $ or percent signs unless specified otherwise.\nIf you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.\nIf you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.\nIf you are unable to determine the final answer, use 'final_answer(\"Unable to determine\")'\n", "task": "At the two-minute mark in the YouTube video uploaded by the channel \u201cGameGrumps\u201d on May 14, 2017 as part of their playthrough of the game Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the shows\u2019 hosts are competing on one of the game\u2019s racetracks.
