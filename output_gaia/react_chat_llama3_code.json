The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i.e., the amount of fluid that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces. By metonymy, the term \"volume\" sometimes is used to refer to the corresponding region.Wikipedia', 'Volume is the amount of space that an object or substance occupies.

Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\n\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the 'Code:' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nAt the end of each intermediate step, you can use a single 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- search: A search engine.

In particular, the university aims to \"re-establish the unity between research and teaching\", and so all its faculty teach courses in their area of research. The university also stresses a focus on interdisciplinary research, helped by the architecture, which encloses all faculties in one great structure. It is among the first of the German universities to switch some faculties to Bachelor/Master-degrees as part of the Bologna process.Wikipediauni-bielefeld.de', 'Bielefeld University type: Public university in Germany.', 'Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the activities of Bielefeld University Library in establishing OAI based repository servers and in using OAI \u2026', 'The agreement enables Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE), a multidisciplinary database operated by Bielefeld University Library, to be indexed in EDS.

Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\n\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the 'Code:' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nAt the end of each intermediate step, you can use a single 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- search: A search engine. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your search query', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached documents.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'image': {'description': 'the image to answer the question on', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\n\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the 'Code:' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nAt the end of each intermediate step, you can use a single 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- search: A search engine. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your search query', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached documents.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'image': {'description': 'the image to answer the question on', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\n\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Identify the oldest person in the `document` and create an image showcasing the result.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document, question=\"What is the oldest person?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\n\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"An image of John Doe, an old man.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Generate an image using the text given in the variable `caption`.\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tool: `image_generator` to generate an image.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(prompt=caption)\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Summarize the text given in the variable `text` and read it out loud.\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `summarizer` to create a summary of the input text, then `text_reader` to read it out loud.\n\nCode:\n```py\nsummarized_text = summarizer(text)\nprint(f\"Summary: {summarized_text}\")\n```<end_code>\n\nObservation: \"Summary: 'The text is about the history of the Roman Empire.'\"\n\nThought: I will now read the summarized text out loud.\n\nCode:\n```py\naudio_summary = text_reader(summarized_text)\nfinal_answer(audio_summary)\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the text in the variable `text`.

Let's compute the result using python code.\n\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\n\nAbove example were using tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n'search', 'visualizer', 'final_answer'\nYou also can perform computations in the python code you generate.\n\nAlways provide a 'Thought:' and an 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence. You MUST provide at least the 'Code:' sequence to move forward.\n\nRemember to not perform too many operations in a single code block! You should split the task into intermediate code blocks. Then use one single print() at the end of each step to save the intermediate result. Then use final_answer() to return the final result.\n\nNow Begin ! \n\nTask: A paper about AI regulation that was originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 shows a figure with three axes, where each axis has a label word at both ends.

Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\n\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the 'Code:' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nAt the end of each intermediate step, you can use a single 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- search: A search engine. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your search query', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached documents.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'image': {'description': 'the image to answer the question on', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\n\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the 'Code:' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nAt the end of each intermediate step, you can use a single 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- search: A search engine.
