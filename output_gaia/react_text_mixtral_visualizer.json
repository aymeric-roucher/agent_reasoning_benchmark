It should be formatted in json. Do not try to escape special characters. Here is an example of a valid $ACTION_JSON_BLOB:\nAction:\n{\n  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,\n  \"action_input\": $INPUT\n}\n\nMake sure to have the $INPUT in the right format for the tool you are using, and do not put variable names as input if you can find the right values.\n\nYou will be given:\n\nTask: the task you are given.\n\nYou should ALWAYS use the following format:\n\nThought: you should always think about one action to take. Then use the action as follows:\nAction:\n$ACTION_JSON_BLOB\nObservation: the result of the action\n... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed. The $ACTION_JSON_BLOB must only use a SINGLE action at a time.)\n\nALWAYS provide a 'Thought:' and an 'Action:' part.
