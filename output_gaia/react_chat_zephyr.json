Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your search query', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nThe way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.\nSpecifically, this json should have a `action` key (name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (input to the tool).\n\nThe value in the \"action\" field should belong to this list: 'calculator', 'search', 'final_answer'.\n\nThe $ACTION_JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. It should be formatted in json. Do not try to escape special characters. Here is an example of a valid $ACTION_JSON_BLOB:\nAction:\n{\n  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,\n  \"action_input\": $INPUT\n}\n\nMake sure to have the $INPUT in the right format for the tool you are using, and do not put variable names as input if you can find the right values.\n\nYou will be given:\n\nTask: the task you are given.\n\nYou should ALWAYS use the following format:\n\nThought: you should always think about one action to take.

The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\n\nIf Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?", "To determine the minimum amount of money Bob can win, we need to find the optimal strategy for his guesses.
