Provide it with detailed context whenever possible.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your question, as a natural language sentence', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached documents.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'image': {'description': 'the image to answer the question on', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': typing.Any, 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

You only have acces to those tools:\n'ask_search_agent', 'visualizer', 'transcriber', 'final_answer'\nYou also can perform computations in the python code you generate.\n\nAlways provide a 'Thought:' and an 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence. You MUST provide at least the 'Code:' sequence to move forward.\n\nRemember to not perform too many operations in a single code block! You should split the task into intermediate code blocks.

Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\n\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the 'Code:' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will help you find the information you need on the internet. Provide it with detailed context whenever possible.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your question, as a natural language sentence', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached documents.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'image': {'description': 'the image to answer the question on', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': typing.Any, 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\n\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the 'Code:' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '/End code' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nIt will then be available in the 'Observation:' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\n\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n- ask_search_agent: A search agent that will help you find the information you need on the internet. Provide it with detailed context whenever possible.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your question, as a natural language sentence', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached documents.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'image': {'description': 'the image to answer the question on', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': typing.Any, 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
