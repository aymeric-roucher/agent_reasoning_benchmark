In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform.

Provide it with detailed context whenever possible.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your question, as a natural language sentence', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached documents.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'image': {'description': 'the image to answer the question on', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': typing.Any, 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_text_file: A tool that will answer your question by loading the file you provide it with. Provide it with detailed context whenever possible.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your question, as a natural language sentence', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'file': {'description': 'the path to the file you want to inspect', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Identify the oldest person in the `document` and create an image showcasing the result.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"What is the oldest person?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"An image of John Doe, an old man.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Generate an image using the text given in the variable `caption`.\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tool: `image_generator` to generate an image.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(prompt=caption)\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Summarize the text given in the variable `text` and read it out loud.\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `summarizer` to create a summary of the input text, then `text_reader` to read it out loud.\n\nCode:\n```py\nsummarized_text = summarizer(text)\nprint(f\"Summary: {summarized_text}\")\n```<end_code>\n\nObservation: \"Summary: 'The text is about the history of the Roman Empire.'\"\n\nThought: I will now read the summarized text out loud.\n\nCode:\n```py\naudio_summary = text_reader(summarized_text)\nfinal_answer(audio_summary)\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the text in the variable `text`.

You MUST provide at least the 'Code:' sequence to move forward.\n\nRemember to not perform too many operations in a single code block! You should split the task into intermediate code blocks. Then use one single print() at the end of each step to save the intermediate result. Then use final_answer() to return the final result.\n\nDO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n\nNow Begin!

Provide it with detailed context whenever possible.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your question, as a natural language sentence', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached documents.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'image': {'description': 'the image to answer the question on', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': typing.Any, 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_text_file: A tool that will answer your question by loading the file you provide it with. Provide it with detailed context whenever possible.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your question, as a natural language sentence', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'file': {'description': 'the path to the file you want to inspect', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Provide it with detailed context whenever possible.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your question, as a natural language sentence', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached documents.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'image': {'description': 'the image to answer the question on', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It returns the transcribed text.\n    Takes inputs: {'audio': {'type': typing.Any, 'description': 'The audio to transcribe'}}\n\n- inspect_text_file: A tool that will answer your question by loading the file you provide it with. Provide it with detailed context whenever possible.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': 'your question, as a natural language sentence', 'type': <class 'str'>}, 'file': {'description': 'the path to the file you want to inspect', 'type': <class 'str'>}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': <class 'str'>, 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

The question is in French.\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Identify the oldest person in the `document` and create an image showcasing the result.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"What is the oldest person?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"An image of John Doe, an old man.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Generate an image using the text given in the variable `caption`.\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tool: `image_generator` to generate an image.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(prompt=caption)\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Summarize the text given in the variable `text` and read it out loud.\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `summarizer` to create a summary of the input text, then `text_reader` to read it out loud.\n\nCode:\n```py\nsummarized_text = summarizer(text)\nprint(f\"Summary: {summarized_text}\")\n```<end_code>\n\nObservation: \"Summary: 'The text is about the history of the Roman Empire.'\"\n\nThought: I will now read the summarized text out loud.\n\nCode:\n```py\naudio_summary = text_reader(summarized_text)\nfinal_answer(audio_summary)\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the text in the variable `text`. Use the answer to generate an image.\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `text_qa` to create the answer, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\n\nBe sure to provide an 'Code:' token, else the system will be stuck in a loop.\n\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = text_qa(text=text, question=question)\nimage = image_generator(answer)\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1298987654.6789098765?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1298987654.6789098765\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '24 million'\n\nThought: I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\nExample:::\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n'ask_search_agent', 'visualizer', 'transcriber', 'inspect_text_file', 'final_answer'\nYou also can perform computations in the python code you generate.\n\nAlways provide a 'Thought:' and an 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence. You MUST provide at least the 'Code:' sequence to move forward.\n\nRemember to not perform too many operations in a single code block! You should split the task into intermediate code blocks. Then use one single print() at the end of each step to save the intermediate result. Then use final_answer() to return the final result.\n\nDO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n\nNow Begin! \n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Task: Which contributor to the version of OpenCV where support was added for the Mask-RCNN model has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when the names are transliterated to the Latin alphabet?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thought: I will use the `inspect_text_file` tool to inspect the OpenCV documentation and find the contributor who added support for the Mask-RCNN model.\n\nCode:\n```py\ncontributors = inspect_text_file(query=\"Who contributed to the Mask-RCNN model in OpenCV?\", file=\"OpenCV documentation.txt\")\nprint(contributors)\n```<end_code>\n\n\n"}, {"role": "tool-response", "content": "Error: Error in execution: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'OpenCV documentation.txt'.
