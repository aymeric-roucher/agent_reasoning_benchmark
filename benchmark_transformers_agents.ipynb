The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don't eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. How many whole bags of potatoes do I need? Just give the number.   \n",

      "183  Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.\\n\\nYou have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show \"Pick That Ping-Pong\". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\\n\\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\\n\\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\\n\\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize?

It can be used to perform simple arithmetic operations.\\n    Takes inputs: {\\'expression\\': {\\'type\\': <class \\'str\\'>, \\'description\\': \"The expression to be evaluated.The variables used CANNOT be placeholders like \\'x\\' or \\'mike\\'s age\\', they must be numbers\"}}\\n\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\\n    Takes inputs: {\\'answer\\': {\\'type\\': <class \\'str\\'>, \\'description\\': \\'The final answer to the problem\\'}}\\n\\nThe way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.\\nSpecifically, this json should have a `action` key (name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (input to the tool).\\n\\nThe value in the \"action\" field should belong to this list: \\'search\\', \\'calculator\\', \\'final_answer\\'.\\n\\nThe $ACTION_JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. It should be formatted in json. Do not try to escape special characters. Here is the template of a valid $ACTION_JSON_BLOB:\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,\\n  \"action_input\": $INPUT\\n}\\n\\nMake sure to have the $INPUT as a dictionnary in the right format for the tool you are using, and do not put variable names as input if you can find the right values.\\n\\nYou will be given:\\n\\nTask: the task you are given.\\n\\nYou should ALWAYS use the following format:\\n\\nThought: you should always think about one action to take. Then use the action as follows:\\nAction:\\n$ACTION_JSON_BLOB\\nObservation: the result of the action\\n... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed. The $ACTION_JSON_BLOB must only use a SINGLE action at a time.)\\n\\nALWAYS provide a \\'Thought:\\' and an \\'Action:\\' sequence. You MUST provide at least the \\'Action:\\' sequence to move forward.\\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.png\".\\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\\n\\nObservation: \"image_1.png\"\\nThought: I need to transform the image that I received in the previous observation to make it green.\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"action\": \"image_transformer\",\\n  \"action_input\": {\"image\": \"image_1.png\"}\\n}\\n\\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"action\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"action\": \"final_answer\",\\n  \"action_input\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\\n}\\n\\nNow begin! \\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Task: The Japanese military officer Kenji Hatanaka conspired to prevent the broadcast of the surrender of this emperor who passed away a few decades later and was succeeded by whom?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Thought: I need to find the emperor who passed away a few decades later and was succeeded by someone.\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"action\": \"search\",\\n  \"action_input\": {\"query\": \"Japanese emperor who surrendered in World War II\"}\\n}\\n\\n\\n'}, {'role': 'tool-response', 'content': 'Observation: Emperor Hirohito'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Thought: I need to find out who succeeded Emperor Hirohito.\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"action\": \"search\",\\n  \"action_input\": {\"query\": \"who succeeded Emperor Hirohito\"}\\n}\\n'}, {'role': 'tool-response', 'content': 'Observation: Akihito'}]}, {'llm_output': 'Thought: I have found the answer to the task.\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"action\": \"final_answer\",\\n  \"action_input\": {\"answer\": \"Akihito\"}\\n}', 'rationale': 'Thought: I have found the answer to the task.\\n\\n', 'tool_call': {'tool_name': 'final_answer', 'tool_arguments': {'answer': 'Akihito'}}}]   \n",

In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\\n\\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\\n\\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\\n\\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize?

Instead, the response incorrectly attributes Fionn's rise to leadership to the death of his father at the hands of Goll mac Morna. This information is not only missing the critical details from the reference answer but also introduces an incorrect cause for Fionn's leadership. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and not factual in the context of the specific act that led to Fionn's leadership as per the reference answer.  \n",

The instruction asks for a physical characteristic of a \"fuchs,\" which is likely a misspelling of \"fox.\" The reference answer provides details about the physical characteristics of a fox. However, the response to evaluate discusses Fuchs' Heterochromic Iridocyclitis (FHI) and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), which are medical conditions related to the human eye and not physical characteristics of a fox. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual in the context of the given instruction.  \n",

Mutulu Shakur was indeed related to Tupac Shakur, as he was Tupac's stepfather. However, the question specifically asks for a close friend of Mutulu Shakur, to which the correct answer is Geronimo Pratt. The response incorrectly identifies Tupac Shakur as the close friend in question, rather than Geronimo Pratt. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for accuracy as per the score rubric.  \n",
      "183  The response provided is not the optimal choice based on the description of the game. The reference answer indicates that ball number 3 would maximize the odds of winning. Since the pistons fire randomly, the ball in the first position has the highest chance of being ejected first, as it will be ejected if either the first or second piston fires. The ball in the second position will only be ejected if the second piston fires, and the ball in the third position will only be ejected if the third piston fires. Therefore, the ball in the first position has a 2/3 chance of being ejected first, making ball number 3 the best choice. The response of choosing ball number 2 does not align with this logic and is not the best choice to maximize the odds of winning. However, it is not completely incorrect as there is still a chance, albeit smaller, that ball number 2 could be ejected if the second piston fires first. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but not the best answer.  \n",

Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.\\n\\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of \\'Thought:\\', \\'Code:\\', and \\'Observation:\\' sequences.\\n\\nAt each step, in the \\'Thought:\\' sequence, you should first explain which tool you will use and for what reason, then in the \\'Code:\\' sequence, you shold write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with \\'/End code\\' sequence.\\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \\'print()\\' to save whatever important information you will then need.\\nIt will then be available in the \\'Observation:\\' field, for using this information as input for the next step.\\n\\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\\nOnly when you use function final_answer() will your final answer be returned.\\n\\nYou have access to the following tools:\\n\\n- search: A search engine.
